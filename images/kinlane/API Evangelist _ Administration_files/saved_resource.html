<p><a href="http://www.veracore.com/" _mce_href="http://www.veracore.com/">VeraCore Software Solutions, Inc.</a> announced today that <a href="http://www.hemlock.com/" _mce_href="http://www.hemlock.com/">Hemlock Printers Ltd.</a>, of Burnaby, British Columbia has selected the VeraCore Fulfillment Solution to manage their growing fulfillment operation.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Established in 1968, Hemlock has grown to become one of the largest and most well respected commercial printers in the Pacific Northwest. Hemlock’s comprehensive suite of services includes offset and digital printing, online solutions, prepress, digital photography, bindery, mailing, warehousing and fulfillment.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">From their secure, climate controlled warehouse, Hemlock manages numerous client fulfillment programs centered on both print and non-print collateral materials. Hemlock also manages magazine subscription fulfillment programs for several of its publishing clients. Hemlock’s primary objective in evaluating fulfillment platforms was to identify a system that would enable them to more efficiently manage warehouse operations while maintaining their high degree of inventory accuracy, even as the business grew.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The VeraCore Warehouse Management System’s support for barcode technology and rules based processing will enable them to increase fulfillment throughput – without a big increase to labor. Richard Kouwenhoven, Hemlock’s President, commented on their decision, “Fulfillment is definitely a growth area for us, so investing in this technology made sense. VeraCore provides our team with the tools to run a highly efficient warehouse operation which meets the expanding needs of our customers.”</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Another important consideration was VeraCore’s ability to integrate with other technologies used by Hemlock.  The VeraCore Fulfillment Solution had already been integrated with several of the systems in use at Hemlock, including ecommerce, web-to-print and shipping systems. For cases in which an integration is not already available, VeraCore’s API will enable Hemlock’s development team to build their own integrations as needed.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Denise Lunden, President of VeraCore Software Solutions, Inc. noted, “Hemlock does many different things for their clients and clearly embraces the philosophy that clients are best served by using the best tool available for the task at hand. I’m confident that VeraCore will play an integral role in Hemlock’s continued success in fulfillment”.</p>
