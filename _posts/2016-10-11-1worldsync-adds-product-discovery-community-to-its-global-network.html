<p class="responsiveNews">Expanding upon 1WorldSyncâs existing set of offerings, Showcase connects sellers and buyers worldwide; enabling sellers to be discovered by existing or new buyers and allowing buyers to search and discover products to diversify their product offerings. The mobile-ready app gives retailers, distributors and wholesalers seamless access to robust product pages from thousands of suppliers, empowering them to diversify their products for greater customer satisfaction.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThereâs a new normal in eCommerce today, where sellers, merchants and distributors are expected to offer tens or hundreds of millions of product choices to the consumer,â said Nick Parnaby, CMO of 1WorldSync. â1WorldSync Showcase gives buyers and category managers a venue to discover new products, and pull rich digital product content from global brands and sellers. We invite our 23,000 member brand community to use the Showcase to drive demand, find new customers and easily share digital content with app developers.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For retailers, distributors and wholesalers looking to diversify their product offerings, 1WorldSync Showcase will enable an easy connection with thousands of suppliers to discover new products and convert more customers. Buyers can search and browse a catalog of products and content direct from manufacturers in their specific industry, empowering retailers to expand their partner community and improve their product selection for consumers. Digital-ready product information can be accessed via simple APIs, decreasing time to market for new product listings on apps or e-commerce properties.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sellersâ product pages are showcased in category-specific catalogs, in which buyers can search, browse, and even download rich product spec sheets. Manufacturers can choose whether their products in the 1WorldSync Showcase applications are public or private, giving them full control over who can view their content.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âHaving already aggregated rich product content from 23,000 brands across the globe, itâs only logical that we should increase the value our customers drive from 1WorldSync by exposing these great products to new buyers and digital product developers who crave trusted content.â said Nihat Arkan, CEO of 1WorldSync. âWhether youâre in retail, grocery, foodservice or healthcare, Showcase will allow you to sell and discover more products to stay competitive and satisfy consumersâ need for detailed product information.â</p>
