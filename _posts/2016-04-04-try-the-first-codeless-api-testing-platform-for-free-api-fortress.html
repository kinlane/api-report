<p>API Fortress is pleased to announce a new self-service feature whereby anyone can create a free account and try the first ever visually guided API testing platform. It is the only tool that offers the ability to test an entire API without needing to write any code. For the first time a QA, Product Manager, or Project Manager can do what was once only possible by developers. All tests are logged, errors are immediately reported, and the information is available on the dashboard for deeper analysis.</p>

<p>API Fortress provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Codeless creation of API tests and monitors.
<li>The ability to build a test in under a minute with the visual composer.
<li>An industry leading assertion library.
<li>Full payload testing.
<li>Comprehensive reports on every test.
<li>Schedule tests to run autonomously.
</ul>

<p>Companies have been inhibited by the challenging technical nature of payload testing. The API Fortress platform will ease technical headaches and save developer hours. Leverage the platformâ€™s extensive assertion library and give your APIs the attention they deserve.</p>
