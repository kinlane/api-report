<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_86163_wellspring_logos_knowledgeinsight.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.wellspring.com">Wellspring</a>, the global leader in software solutions for tech transfer, intellectual property, and tech scouting, today launched the Advanced Patent Utility (APU) for Wellspringâs software products. The APU feature brings together several automated features for updating intellectual property data, including new functionality to synchronize patent records with critical information and changes in status in patent officesâ databases.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For example, as part of the APU, Wellspring now provides an application interface (API) to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and the European Patent Office (EPO). The USPTO and EPO API âs save Wellspring users time manually entering data which in turn reduces errors in recording essential patent data.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To enable users to meet deadlines and make informed decisions, the APU automatically generates due dates and alerts for Office Actions as well as maintenance renewals. Additional tools include assigning tasks and IP notification alerts. Redundant effort is also eliminated with one-click nationalization to multiple jurisdictions from an original IP filing.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Matt Hamilton, Wellspringâs Chief Operating Officer, commented, âThe integrations with USPTO and EPO further our mission to empower our clients to manage all aspects of their intellectual assets from one system. Clients can confirm they have the latest information from the patent offices. Moreover, users can eliminate unnecessary data entry while ensuring their valuable patents are maintained and protected globally. Wellspring will continue to add integrations as part of the APU to help users make the most of their IP investments.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A summary report of all updates to the patent application is available in Wellspringâs software solutions. The API plug-ins are easy to install and only require a couple of fields to be added to the patent form in Wellspring software. Docket reports are also available in the APU.</p>
