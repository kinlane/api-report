This latest release gives clients of Constellation Payments greater flexibility and control in setting, managing and calculating surcharges and convenience fees.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âAs a trusted leader in the payment processing industry, weâre committed to delivering enhancements that enable our clients to be even more successful in their line of work,â said Steven Pinado, CEO of Constellation Payments. âThis update is just one example of our commitment and investment in building and maintaining a solid, secure payment processing infrastructure enhanced by great service and flexibility.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Constellation Payments was created to address the unique needs of software companies that have embedded point of sale (POS) and payment processing requirements for their customers. Over a short period of time, the company has become a trusted technology and support partner to dozens of POS software providers representing a wide variety of verticals.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Unlike other merchant service providers, Constellation Payments has direct oversight and control of its own proprietary payment transaction gateway, offering both merchant processing accounts and gateway services. This unique combination enables the team at Constellation Payments to follow sales from the point of sale through to the gateway and ultimately the processor â giving clients of Constellation Payments the highest level of support, in addition to one simple software integration process for easy payment processing.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Through the new release, Constellation Payments clients now have extreme flexibility in how surcharges and convenience fees are calculated. Clients can choose to:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Charge a fixed dollar amount across four different tiers</li>
<li>Charge a fixed percentage across four different tiers</li>
<li>Add a flexible rate based on the actual cost of the transaction by card type</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Other platform enhancements within this release enable Constellation Payments clients to process surcharges and convenience fees through specified fee processors and to calculate surcharges and convenience fees for specific transactions through the companyâs API.</p>
