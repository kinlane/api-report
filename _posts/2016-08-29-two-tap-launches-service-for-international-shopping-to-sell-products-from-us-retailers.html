<p><a href="https://twotap.com/"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/news/gI_61211_Two-Tap-Flow_Crossborder.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://twotap.com/">Two Tap</a> announced record growth data and launched Two Tap Crossborder, the first fully automated service that allows consumers outside of the U.S. to order products from American retailers just as easy as buying locally in their own country. U.S. retailers can now expand global sales to shoppers anywhere in the world without making any changes to their existing infrastructure. Retailers that sign up for the new Two Tap Crossborder service can start selling their products inside any international app or online marketplace.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new service is available to any U.S. retailer and is an add-on to Two Tap Gateway -- a platform enabling retailers to integrate with external partners -- which doubled its size to over 1,300 supported retailers over the past 12 months and added automatic support for Shopify retailers that sign up for Two Tap Gateway. Meanwhile, Two Tap is also the most convenient way for any shopping site or app publisher to make money by selling hundreds of millions of products from thousands of retailers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Retailer Global Expansion Challenges</strong><br />Today&rsquo;s existing solutions for international shoppers that want to buy products from U.S. retailers do not solve several key challenges. First, consumers overseas often can only buy and receive products from one retailer at a time, making it more costly and difficult for them to have easy access to U.S. products. The reason is that many partners that help retailers to ship abroad often lack the infrastructure to consolidate multiple products from multiple retailers in their warehouses.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Second, it&rsquo;s very difficult for overseas consumers to shop online from U.S. stores. The biggest problem is that most U.S. retailers either do not accept international debit or credit card payments or flag orders as fraudulent, especially those without a verified U.S. address. In addition, customers outside of the U.S. are often forced to pay in U.S. dollars rather than their local currency, an inconvenience that often means higher prices due to unfavorable exchange rates. This creates another sales growth barrier for American retailers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Two Tap Crossborder solves these challenges and allows anyone outside of the U.S. to buy and receive any product from U.S. retailers and, for the first time, to know the exact product cost in their local currency before it ships. International consumers also have access to supported retailers&rsquo; entire inventory, which will make Two Tap Crossborder one of the biggest international retailers in terms of total number of products offered.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Two Tap Crossborder &ndash; How it Works</strong><br />Two Tap Crossborder solves all of the above challenges by automating the entire purchase, inventory management, shipping, and customer support process &ndash; empowering retailers to make selling overseas as easy as buying from a local store. The process is fast and easy:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy shopping &ndash; The international customer shops on a website or app using a Buy Button that has Two Tap Crossborder enabled. The customer can see a fully landed cost for their cart, pay in local currency and have the product delivered to their local address.</li>
<li>Two Tap Becomes the Merchant of Record &ndash; Two Tap processes the payment for the shopper and automatically orders the products for delivery.</li>
<li>No Technical Integration &amp; No Fraud Risk for Retailers &ndash; Two Tap takes on the risk and effort of enabling Crossborder commerce for its partners. Retailers only need to sign up on Two Tap&rsquo;s website to enable Crossborder.</li>
<li>Order Consolidation &ndash; Two Tap consolidates the products into the most efficient number and size of shipping packages and manages international delivery with its shipping partners. International customers can order any amount of products from participating U.S. retailers and benefit from one delivery to their international address.</li>
