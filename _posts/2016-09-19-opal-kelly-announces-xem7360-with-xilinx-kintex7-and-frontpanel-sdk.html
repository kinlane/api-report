<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_84338_xem7360_perspective.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.opalkelly.com">Opal Kelly</a>, a leading producer of powerful FPGA modules that provide essential device-to-computer interconnect using USB or PCI Express, announced the XEM7360 USB 3.0 FPGA Module, combining a SuperSpeed USB 3.0 interface and a Xilinx Kintex-7 FPGA into a compact mezzanine-style module for high-performance prototyping, testing, and production-ready integration. The XEM7360 USB interface delivers real-world transfer rates exceeding 340 MB/s. The module includes integrated DDR3 memory, voltage and current monitoring on multiple power supply rails, board-level and FPGA temperature monitoring, and abundant I/O including gigabit transceiver capabilities. Opal Kelly's FrontPanel SDK is included with the module.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The XEM7360 measures only 100mm x 70mm x 19.56mm (3.94" x 2.76" x 0.77") and includes the Xilinx XC7K160T-1FFG676C FPGA (XC7K410T-1FFG676C optional), USB 3.0 interface, 64 Mb SPI Flash, 100 MHz and 200 MHz low-jitter clock oscillators, and 2 GB DDR3 SDRAM on a 32-bit data bus. The XEM7360 fully supports Opal Kellyâs popular cross-platform FrontPanel SDK for FPGA configuration and host communication using a simple API in C/C++, C#, Python, Java, and Ruby programming languages. The XEM7360 may also be configured to boot the FPGA in non-tethered mode from the on-board SPI Flash.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Several on-board power supplies efficiently generate all required power rails from a single 5-volt input. Three programmable power rails are available to the user peripheral to accommodate different FPGA I/O voltages. Opal Kelly's Device Sensors API is also supported providing real-time voltage and current monitoring of several of the power rails as well as board temperature and FPGA temperature. Kintex-7 transceivers support the JESD204B data converter serial interface, serial standards such as PCI Express, DisplayPort, SATA, HD-SDI, XAUI, Aurora, and others operating at up to 12.5 Gb/s. Over 190 FPGA fabric I/O are available on the two Samtec expansion connectors.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The XEM7360 is a perfect match for the companyâs Integration and Acceleration target markets. System integrators can build fully-operational prototype and production designs with peripherals developed in-house. With ample logic resources, the Kintex-7 is also suited to signal processing and image processing for acceleration tasks when mated to image capture or data acquisition hardware.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">JESD204B is a data converter serial interface standard created through the JEDEC committee to reduce data I/O counts for high speed data converters. The standard is now supported by several converter manufacturers such as Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, Intersil, IDT, Linear, and many others as well as FPGAs from Altera and Xilinx. The XEM7360 is a cost-effective host for JESD204B converters such as the Analog Devices AD9250. Engineers building systems with JESD204B converters can take advantage of the XEM7360 during prototyping and integration to dramatically improve time to market of production systems. Xilinx LogiCORE IP is available (from Xilinx) for the Kintex-7 to support customer design.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Opal Kelly integration modules include the indispensable FrontPanel SDK, a powerful trio of firmware, software, and programmable hardware blocks that connect the engineerâs software application and FPGA firmware. The FrontPanel SDK dramatically reduces development time and risk and accelerates time to market. The multi-platform, multi-language FrontPanel programmerâs interface (API) accommodates most development environments and provides a consistent, easy-to-use architecture supporting Opal Kellyâs USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 devices. The FrontPanel SDK has over a decade of demonstrated success, proven and refined in thousands of customer deployments worldwide, across diverse applications and industries.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The XEM7360-K160T is available now with the K160T device density. The XEM7360-K410T will be made available later this year with the higher-density K410T device. The XEM7360-K160T is in stock and available now through Opal Kellyâs online web store at $1,699.95 (qty 1) with volume discounts starting at 10 pieces. The BRK7360 breakout and reference board is also available now through the online store at $129.95. Please contact sales(at)opalkelly.com for additional information or pre-sales questions.</p>
