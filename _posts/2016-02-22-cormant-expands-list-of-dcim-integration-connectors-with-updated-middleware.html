<p><a href="http://www.cormant.com">Cormant, Inc.</a>, a data center infrastructure management (DCIM) pure-play expert for the data center and beyond, today announced its brand new &lsquo;2.0&rsquo; Middleware platform; Cormant-EDIS (External Data Integration Service). The updated platform includes connectors that make it faster than ever for customers to leverage the flow of data between existing systems.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Cormant has aggressively developed Cormant-EDIS to simplify the cost and duration of system integrations. With Cormant-EDIS, little to no programming is required; it facilitates bi-directional information exchange and establishes business rules for that exchange.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Customers who had replaced their previous data center tools with Cormant-CS were always amazed at how quickly we completed integrations,&rdquo; explained Paul Friday, Cormant&rsquo;s Chief Technology Officer. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve now taken it to an entirely new level with more intuitive mapping, logging, and syncing. We&rsquo;ve programmed complex code so customers don&rsquo;t have to when they use our integration connectors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Cormant-EDIS can deliver a greater range of integrations than its Middleware predecessor, introduced in 2009. The updates have allowed Cormant to nearly double its Cormant-CS connectors in the past year. Though Cormant-CS has always been able to easily integrate with any solution because of its built-in SNMP, WMI and XML scripting as well as an open API, connectors are a way for customers to integrate in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Customer needs were simpler in 2009; back then, we mainly integrated with CMDBs or an occasional financial solution,&rdquo; explained Cormant&rsquo;s CEO, Paul Goodison. &ldquo;Today, DCIM&rsquo;s value goes beyond visibility. DCIM has the unique ability to share different, yet related information with many other systems in a faster, more flexible way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The most popular Cormant-EDIS connectors are for the leading BMS, ITSM, and CMDB systems, as well as those for power management and all types of sensors. However, Cormant offers connectors for CRM&rsquo;s, financial systems, and many more to round out its library. Visit Cormant&rsquo;s integration page to see the up-to-date list.</p>
