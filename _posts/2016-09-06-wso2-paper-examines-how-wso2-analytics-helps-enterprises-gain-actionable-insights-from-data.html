<p>Today, unprecedented volumes of data are pouring into organizations from the web, mobile devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. As a result, enterprises face increasingly complex demands for capturing this information in a timely way, analyzing it for meaningful insights, and then communicating the results effectively. In a new white paper, WSO2 examines how its fully open source analytics platform can help IT professionals to address these challenges.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The white paper, &ldquo;Everything You Need to Know About the WSO2 Analytics Platform,&rdquo; was written by WSO2 Senior Software Engineer Sajith Ravindra. He begins by presenting a typical scenario in which an enterprise needs to rely on technologies to gain valuable insights from data and make more informed business decisions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Next, Sajith discusses the functionality of the WSO2 analytics platform and how it supports a combination of batch, real-time, predictive and interactive analytics. He also examines how the platform supports key analytics requirements. These include data collection, data analysis, the publication of result streams, the ability to build machine-learning models for predictive analysis, and the communication of results through dashboard visualizations of key performance indicators (KPIs).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additionally, Sajith reviews how the analytics platform functionality has been incorporated into other WSO2 products for API management, mobile and IoT device management, security, and enterprise service bus (ESB) enabled integration. He then explores the ways in which the WSO2 analytics platform and other WSO2 software can be used to analyze data from a range of sources, including Facebook and Twitter. Sajith also discusses a number of widely adopted, industry-standard protocols supported by the platform to receive and publish data.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">He concludes by explaining how WSO2 supports enterprise demands with:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> The capabilities to support comprehensive analytics end-to-end</li>
