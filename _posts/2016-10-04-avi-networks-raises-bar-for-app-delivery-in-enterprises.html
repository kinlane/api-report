<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/avi_networks.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /><a href="http://www.avinetworks.com">Avi Networks</a>, the leader in next-generation application services,&nbsp;today announced a significant upgrade to the&nbsp;Avi&nbsp;Vantage Platform&nbsp;that&nbsp;delivers compelling advantages for&nbsp;enterprises&nbsp;moving to&nbsp;hybrid&nbsp;and multi-cloud deployments to support their applications. With the new release,&nbsp;IT departments&nbsp;can for the first time use application delivery controllers (ADCs) to centrally&nbsp;orchestrate&nbsp;and scale&nbsp;load balancing and applications services&nbsp;across private and multiple public clouds. The Avi Vantage Platform empowers global enterprises&nbsp;to&nbsp;regain control of their applications by easily standardizing load balancing across any cloud, eliminating the need to rearchitect applications, gaining full visibility into application performance through sophisticated analytics, and avoiding lock-in with any single public cloud provider.</p>
<p>Enterprises&nbsp;are increasingly treating&nbsp;public clouds&nbsp;as a logical extension of their private data centers. The goal is to seamlessly move workloads between the environments, scale applications across sites or clouds, and&nbsp;make intelligent traffic management decisions based on&nbsp;financial considerations. However, this objective has been limited by&nbsp;the lack of&nbsp;multi-cloud application services that can manage and execute load balancing, visibility, analytics and autoscaling across these environments.</p>
<p>The latest upgrade to the&nbsp;Avi&nbsp;Vantage&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;fulfills the vision of a&nbsp;multi-cloud computing environment.&nbsp;For the first time, organizations can deploy applications in their data center and&nbsp;dynamically&nbsp;scale out&nbsp;load balancers as well as&nbsp;application servers by bursting compute capacity to the&nbsp;public&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;predictively&nbsp;based on changes in traffic&nbsp;patterns. The&nbsp;Avi&nbsp;Platform then&nbsp;intelligently manages traffic&nbsp;across these environments while giving administrators&nbsp;central control and visibility to monitor the health of their applications. Businesses&nbsp;across all industry verticals including&nbsp;online retail and ecommerce, payment processing, media and technology can immediately benefit from these capabilities.</p>
<p>Key&nbsp;capabilities in the&nbsp;new version of the&nbsp;Avi&nbsp;Vantage Platform, available within 30 days, include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Multi-cloud&nbsp;Autoscaling&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Combines analytics-driven&nbsp;autoscaling&nbsp;with&nbsp;cloud integrations and global&nbsp;server&nbsp;load&nbsp;balancing (GSLB) to&nbsp;make&nbsp;it possible to easily deploy, manage and scale applications&nbsp;across private and multiple public clouds.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">DNS Service for Amazon AWS &ndash;&nbsp;Extends integration with AWS with built-in IPAM and DNS capabilities for improved automation in AWS.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Google Cloud Support&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Integrates with Google cloud APIs to provide automation and self-services for applications.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Extended OpenStack support&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;Integrates with version 2 of the OpenStack Load Balancing as a Service API for turnkey private cloud deployments.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The new release of the Avi Vantage Platform is a significant milestone for our company and enhances our mission of providing&nbsp;infrastructure-agnostic application delivery services&nbsp;with intelligent traffic management&nbsp;for modern applications,&rdquo; said Guru&nbsp;Chahal, vice president of products at&nbsp;Avi&nbsp;Networks &ldquo;It addresses the requirements of our largest enterprise customers who have developed and deployed applications&nbsp;in their OpenStack or VMware private clouds, public clouds, and software-defined data centers, where they want to deploy and manage applications and traffic across any of these environments in a cost-effective manner.&rdquo;</p>
