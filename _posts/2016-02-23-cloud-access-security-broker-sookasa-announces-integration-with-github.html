<p><a href="https://www.sookasa.com">Cloud security company Sookasa</a> today announced a native integration with GitHub, the largest host of source code in the world. As part of the integration, Sookasa also launched GitHub Audit, which helps administrators mitigate security risks on the GitHub platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to present our integration with GitHub,&rdquo; said Asaf Cidon, CEO and co-founder of Sookasa. &ldquo;Enterprises in the tech industry and beyond are increasingly viewing their source code as one of their most prized forms of intellectual property. And no wonder: Companies have to protect themselves and the backbones of their businesses against the growing risks of rogue employees stealing information or hackers injecting malicious code.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">GitHub has more than 12 million users, who rely on GitHub to discover and contribute to more than 31 million projects. In recent years, it has become the central repository where corporations manage their development projects. GitHub&rsquo;s open source technology helps teams manage changes in their code and merge these with a master version. Security challenges surrounding code, which are not specific to GitHub, have recently been big news: Last month, Reuters reported that an ex-IBM employee was arrested for code theft, and Wired and others reported on how Juniper Networks recently came under fire when malicious code was discovered in its firewall.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By leveraging GitHub&rsquo;s API, Sookasa&rsquo;s GitHub Audit enables team administrators to monitor real-time activity across team accounts, audit who has access and contributes to repositories both public and private, and enforce policies like two-factor authentication. Gaining visibility into how users are collaborating on GitHub is key to ensuring that proprietary company data is being adequately protected.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sookasa, an API-based Cloud Access Security Broker, simplifies SaaS security with a holistic suite of security products that detect potential data breach risks, protect important information, and enforce security policies. Its GitHub product integrates seamlessly with its offerings for Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and Slack. Companies that use these products with Sookasa&rsquo;s security platform are able to centralize their security tools in a single admin console.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that GitHub is the preferred solution among developers, and our Audit product gives administrators the peace of mind they need to incorporate GitHub into their development environments,&rdquo; Cidon said.</p>
