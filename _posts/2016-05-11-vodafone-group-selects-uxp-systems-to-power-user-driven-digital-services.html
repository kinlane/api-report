<p><a href="http://www.uxpsystems.com">UXP Systems</a>, the leader in User Lifecycle Management for operators, announced today that Vodafone Group has selected its MINT Digital Experience Engine to unify user-based access to existing services, and set a foundation for cloud, over-the-top and connected life services. This technology enables Vodafone to provide users of its services considerably simpler access and better usability. Vodafone will initially launch the MINT Digital Experience Engine in Germany.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Operators have a tremendous opportunity to both transform their digital user initiatives across fixed and wireless services, and further expand the business opportunity to use identity as the anchor to the connected life,&rdquo; says Ash Kumar, Vice President of Global Sales, UXP Systems. &ldquo;We are pleased to have been selected by Vodafone, one of the world&rsquo;s leading telecommunications groups, to support their vision of seamless digital user experiences and simplified, next generation service enablement.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">UXP Systems&rsquo; Digital Experience Engine will address the needs of Vodafone&rsquo;s digital users by:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>empowering every end user to self-manage and unify disparate digital identities across fixed and wireless services;</li>
<li>supporting flexible role management for household members and the delegation of access to services by entitled members to other digital users;</li>
<li>providing federated identity across different user aliases, including devices, networks and the emerging GSMA Mobile Connect&trade; standard;</li>
<li>deep-linking of the operator identity to downstream services and APIs; enabling more immersive and blended connected life experiences; and</li>
<li>building a more complete view of every individual user and personalizing the service experience.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are starting to see more projects like this emerge among operators transitioning to become digital service providers. Those that consider a transformation layer above B/OSS to provide the user processes necessary for user driven digital service experiences enjoy the benefits of a much faster transformation without having to consider expensive and time consuming changes to their existing back-end systems,&rdquo; said Mark Mortensen, Research Director and Practice Leader at Analysys Mason. &ldquo;In addition, operators that take this approach will ultimately strengthen their position in the digital value chain, and create more intimate and loyal relationships with everyone in their user community.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">UXP Systems&rsquo; Digital Experience Engine leverages User Lifecycle Management, which provides a comprehensive set of digital business processes to innovate above existing legacy BSS/OSS systems and implement identity driven digital processes for every end user. It also implements a unique user-driven Multiservice Gateway allowing any downstream service to leverage the operator&rsquo;s managed identities, providing a richer and more seamless user-centric experience. UXP Systems&rsquo; Digital Experience Engine is powering the transformation of service providers without expensive and intrusive customization of underling systems; enabling them to remain relevant and innovative in the face of internet players and over-the-top competitors.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">UXP Systems will be participating at TM Forum Live! 2016 in Nice, France, May 9-12 and can be found at Booth 320.</p>
