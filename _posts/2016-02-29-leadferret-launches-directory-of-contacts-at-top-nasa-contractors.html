<p>Today <a href="http://www.LeadFerret.com">LeadFerret</a>, the free B2B data site, announced the release of their latest specialty directory of contacts at the largest NASA contractors. Each contact in this directory includes full information, including email addresses, telephone numbers, and social media links where applicable, and they all work for companies that have won big contracts from NASA.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Many people don't realize that the NASA "team" that has done things like put men on the moon and send a probe to Mars is actually 75% contractors.  That's right, 3 out of 4 members of the greater NASA team are contractors.  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) currently awards about $17 billion in contracts annually, and this directory is comprised of the companies who received the largest total dollar amount in awards in 2014.  The $17 billion these contractors are all getting a piece of may seem like a lot, and it is, but it's actually down significantly from the 1960's when NASA's annual budget for contractors was routinely in excess of $30 billion (adjusted for inflation).  In fact, NASA currently spends only about .5% of the Federal budget on contracts, whereas in 1966 that number was over 4%.  In 1966 there were about 400,000 people dedicated to the NASA effort between direct NASA employees and contractors, while today that number is estimated to be only about 80,000.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">None the less, there are still big dollars in NASA contracts, and when those contractors are awarded these contracts, they in turn also have significant budgets with which to deliver on those contracts.  That makes this directory ideal for subcontractors and/or anyone that provides a space exploration related product, service, or solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">It's also worth noting the interesting mix of companies and institutions that appear in this directory.  There are the usual suspects like Boeing and Lockheed Martin, but many people may be surprised to find out that some of the largest NASA contractors are actually universities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This directory was compiled in part based on information found at bga-aeroweb.com and nasa.gov.</p>
