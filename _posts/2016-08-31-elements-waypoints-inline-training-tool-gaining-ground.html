<p>Earlier this year <a href="http://learning.riptidesoftware.com/">Riptide&rsquo;s Learning Division</a> added to their html5 courseware arsenal. In addition to the Elements courseware, that delivers highly interactive elearning to any device and in any language, Elements released an innovative new courseware product, Waypoints. Elements&reg; WayPoints provides an in-line training experience that can work for any web-based software. The major portion of WayPoints courseware involves a unique learning experience in-line with the product and it provides simulations through guided workflows that have the learner directly interfacing with the software. Using xAPI, Waypoints also provides competency based assessments and training activity data.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In only a couple of months Waypoints has seen a measurable amount of success in large enterprise business and for military training systems. Two major corporations, a legal research, technology, and human expertise platform; and a company that provides services to the global airline industry, both multi-billion dollar in revenue, are able to prove software usage competencies with Waypoints. Both companies are using multiple services from the Elements platform. The airline service company is using the entire LMS platform, while the technology and human expertise platform is using a collection of micro-services and Riptide Elements is integrating into their proprietary LMS.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To complement the Waypoints product, Riptide is adding an authoring feature to allow training workflows to be created directly by the end user very rapidly. This authoring component makes Waypoints accessible to non-technical authors allowing them to create their own workflows. In addition, the author can create different types of overlays from popovers, transitions, to modals.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Traditionally software help and training materials are always out of date with the latest version of the software,&rdquo; said Nick Washburn, Director of Riptide&rsquo;s Learning Division, &ldquo;Waypoints can ensure the help and training is always up to date with the software and will also empower our client base to better understand and improve their software product.&rdquo;</p>
