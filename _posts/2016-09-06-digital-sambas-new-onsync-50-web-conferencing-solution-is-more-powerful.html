<p>Unlike conventional web conferencing tools that are restricted by inefficient codecs, limited by bandwidth constraints, and require complex on-premise installations and configurations, OnSync is entirely browser-based, cross-platform and mobile. As a result, whether they wish to attend a webinar, virtual classroom, sales presentation or any other event, participants simply and rapidly access a private online meeting room to enjoy a multi-point, high resolution video and voice experience supported by a range of advanced features including: screen sharing, document sharing, chat, session recording, and more.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">And now in the new OnSync 5.0, organizations, teams and all other web conference participants can take advantage of several major improvements including:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>A completely re-invented interface that is sleeker, streamlined, and has a flatter design user interface that makes navigation easier and more intuitive.</li>
<li>Substantially faster performance that results in rapid page loads and more fluid navigation.</li>
<li>A suite of new features, such as the ability for participants to dial into a telephone conference and connect seamlessly with participants of a VoIP webinar.</li>
<li>Powerful, yet easy-to-use new telephony controls to administer PhoneSync servers, Gateways and Bridge APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition, OnSync 5.0 lets organizations easily adjust the web conference solution&rsquo;s UI to align with their brand, which is especially important and valuable to white label resellers. For example, organizations can select custom colors for various design elements (menus, backgrounds, buttons, links, etc.), upload logos and images, and more.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Since launching OnSync, we have always focused on quality, performance and delivering an exceptional user experience,&rdquo; commented Robert Strobl, CMO of Digital Samba&rsquo;s CMO. &ldquo;That is why 95 percent of OnSync web conference meetings are rated as good or excellent, and it is also why the additions and improvements in our latest version are based on feedback from our global community of customers. We understand that OnSync has to fit into their organization, support their teams, and enhance web conference performance and productivity. Version 5.0 takes this vision and commitment to a whole new level, and the response we have received so far has been overwhelmingly positive&rdquo;.</p>
