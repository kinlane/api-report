<p><a href="https://www.mediware.com/">Mediware Information Systems, Inc.</a>, the leader in integrated health and human services management, announced the release of SAMS Application Program Interface (API). SAMS API allows for the bidirectional exchange of data between third-party systems and our flagship case management solution, SAMS (Social Assistance Management System). This advancement will enable SAMS administrators to simplify data collection and entry while streamlining workflow processes, reducing data errors, and improving data assembly for caseworkers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;This capability provides organizations of all sizes with the tools necessary to utilize other data systems in conjunction with SAMS to most effectively collect and securely share consumer data,&rdquo; said Jim Sackett, director of Aging Solutions for Mediware Information Systems. &ldquo;The result is that administrators can maximize their productivity and efficiency, which will ultimately result in a more consistent and higher quality of care for their consumers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Some of the powerful features of SAMS API include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Fully scalable to meet the needs of State Units on Aging, local Area Agencies on Aging, and consumer-focused service providers</li>
<li> Highly configurable so it can easily interface with multiple instances of third-party systems</li>
<li> Enhancement strictly obeys SAMS organizational and role-based security settings </li>
<li> Designed to fully emulate the SAMS data entry experience for all third-party systems</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">SAMS API is the perfect solution for organizations that use multiple systems to gather and exchange consumer data because it prevents unnecessary and unwanted updates to the SAMS administrative tables.</p>
