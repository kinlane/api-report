<p><a href="http://www.opt-intelligence.com/">Opt-Intelligence</a>, a leading provider of third party email list growth solutions, has integrated with Facebook's Marketing API to offer programmatic access to Facebook lead ads. Starting today, with just a few clicks, clients can transform their existing Opt-Intelligence ads into Facebook lead ads and grow their email lists on Facebook.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The integration with Facebook&rsquo;s marketing platform gives clients:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Programmatic access: More efficient than manual</li>
<li>Automated data transfer: Get data from Facebook lead ads and send it where it needs to go</li>
<li>Email confirmation series: Automated follow up to each opt-in generated with lead ads</li>
<li>One stop shop: Reduce work by centralizing third party email list growth efforts</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">This initiative is a direct result of clients demanding more third party sources for growing their email lists, according to Opt-Intelligence CEO, Joe Broumand.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Integrating with the Facebook lead ads was a natural next step for us in meeting our client's needs," said Broumand, CEO of Opt-Intelligence. "They are looking for an easy way to grow their email lists from multiple, high-quality, third party sources without duplicating effort. We can now give our clients access to our proprietary network of publishers as well as the ability to buy lead ads programmatically on Facebook, all from one place."</p>
