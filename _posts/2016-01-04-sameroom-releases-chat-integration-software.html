<p><a href="https://sameroom.io/">Sameroom</a>, an enterprise chat integration company, today announced the launch of its Sameroom Attend feature, which provides full sync integrations between professional chat systems (backends) and customer-facing communication tools (frontends). Sameroom Attend currently supports Slack as a backend and any combination of Facebook Messenger, Intercom, Skype, and Twitter as frontends.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With Sameroom Attend, companies can use a single tool&mdash;team chat&mdash;to respond to new questions from customers and partners, arriving from multiple directions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sameroom was built by Andrei Soroker and Peter Hizalev, previously of enterprise chat product Kato. The company makes chat integration software that connects disparate chat apps like Slack, HipChat, and Hangouts. Just as email clients like Lotus Notes and Microsoft mail were once incompatible, so are today&rsquo;s enterprise chat applications. They serve an important purpose in enterprise communication, but need a way to be connected and allow cross-team and cross-company collaboration without hassle. Sameroom is solving that problem with its real-time gateway technology.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Business chat has proven to be the collaboration rocket fuel for small teams, enabling startups and groups within large companies to eliminate email, streamline communication, and facilitate remote working environments. However, cross-team and cross-company collaboration is still extremely difficult&mdash;people are forced to invite each other into their respective chat solutions, requiring tedious switching between teams, tabs, and applications&mdash;frequently resulting in a fallback to email. This problem is particularly vexing for agencies, CIOs, CSOs, IT Managers, and others who need efficient communication across multiple concurrent projects and platforms.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The collaboration market is exploding: since 2012, ChatGrape, Chatwork, Cisco Spark, Cotap, Evernote Work Chat, Facebook at Work, Fleep, Flock, Flowdock, Gitter, Glip, Hall, Intellinote, Jandi, Jive Chime, Kato, Moxtra, Pie, Quip, Slack, Symphony, Talko, Teamchat, Tricube, Unison, Wire, and Zulip all entered the space. There is another army of startups working to usher email into the 21st century, and an untold number creating hybrid solutions that bring it all under one roof&ndash;collaboration, CRM, project management, and customer support.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To begin addressing this fragmentation, Soroker and Hizalev launched Sameroom in March 2015. Now, they&rsquo;ve released Sameroom Attend&mdash;it lets companies use team chat to respond to customer conversations coming from multiple directions, like a Facebook Page, Twitter, or Intercom. This allows all employees&mdash;not just customer support representatives&mdash;to attend to customer support matters without dealing with additional user accounts or adopting new applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About Sameroom</strong><br />Sameroom provides real-time interoperability gateways available for Campfire, Facebook Messenger, Fleep, Flowdock, Gitter, Google Hangouts, HipChat, Intercom, IRC, Salesforce Chatter, Skype, Slack, Telegram, and Twitter.
