<p class="responsiveNews">DynaFile, enabling companies to streamline HR by replacing bulky filing cabinets with easy to manage electronic files, now offers an integration into the iCIMS Talent Platform, a suite of cloud-based talent acquisition tools that enables organizations to attract, screen, and hire the best talent for their ever-changing business needs. Through the partnership, HR professionals can automate the transition of new recruits from candidate to productive new hire, while also helping to reduce paperwork, manage tasks more efficiently, and improve productivity and employee engagement. The integration with iCIMS automatically files all completed onboarding paperwork within DynaFile, in automatically generated new hire folders, where HR can instantly retrieve employee information, easily manage access and retention rules, and self-audit documentation, to achieve the dream of a paperless office.</p>
