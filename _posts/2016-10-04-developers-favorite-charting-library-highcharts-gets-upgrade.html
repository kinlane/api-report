<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/highcharts_chart.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>Simplified chart development for web designers and developers, enhanced mobile responsiveness, and accessibility are some of the innovations in Highcharts, Highmaps and Highstock Version 5, released today. Â  Â </p>
<p class="responsiveNews">After nearly 2 years of development, these and several other enhancements have been implemented to support emerging web development frameworks and coding practices. Highcharts 5 now includes an API for responsiveness, dynamic update for all options, and a fully Node-based build system. All part files are in ES6 module format, making the library ready for the new standard within JavaScript development.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additionally, there is now an option to fully separate SVG from CSS. âWith old IE web browsers mostly phased out, it was no longer necessary or practical to rely on JavaScript to provide a consistent API across browsers. Instead, ubiquitous and stylable SVG offers cleaner separation of chart layout and design. Developers may now set up the general chart functionality and let designers use their favorite CSS tricks to refine the look and feel,â says Highsoft founder, Torstein HÃ¸nsi.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Other features web developers will appreciate include the option to generate mobile-friendly responsive charts, just like one would build responsive web pages, as well as dynamic updating of selected chart data without destroying and redrawing the whole chart.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Last, but not least, Highcharts now sports industry-leading Section 508 accessibility support, developed in partnership with Elsevier, a world-leading provider of scientific, technical and medical information products and services, and accessibility specialists and end users.</p>
