Companies operating in the area have to face an unsure playing field while banks and other companies are not able to efficiently follow compliance requirements around blockchain transactions. As the market continues to grow with more and more entities adopting blockchain and digital currencies so does the urgency for a service that efficiently provides enough transparency and risk analysis for businesses and institutions to properly follow requirements. Also, without clear and efficient insight into blockchain assets and transactions, companies and institutions lack a complete picture when going through traditional compliance and analysis procedures. Integrating Bisnode's global database with one of the largest structured blockchain database's that sits behind Coinfirm's platform solves both needs with a powerful one-stop shop solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Coinfirm's platform is blockchain and digital currency agnostic but their main service addresses AML risk and compliance for bitcoin's public blockchain. The combination of their blockchain analysis and compliance platform with one of the leading data and analytics companies births opportunities and addresses problems affecting both the traditional and blockchain markets.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âA major player in blockchain compliance and analysis and a major player in business intelligence and data analysis coming together is an obvious powerful combo that affects both the traditional and blockchain related business equation," said Pawel Kuskowski, CEO & Co-Founder of Coinfirm. "Not only is it taking AML, KYC and compliance for the growing digital currency and blockchain ecosystem into the next sphere but also doing the same for the overall compliance and business intelligence world. Itâs a no-brainer for both of us and for what the market needs and will increasingly need.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The problems around compliance and risk analysis in the traditional financial system are well known and being repeated in the blockchain ecosystem with large battles and costs for entities operating within. Companies and institutions receive vast amounts of data and must dedicate significant additional amounts of labor, time and resources to sift through all of it and pull out actionable conclusions, and the situation for bitcoin and other digital currency-related companies is the same. Bisnode and Coinfirm's services are going to help change this reality with Coinfirm's platform delivering clear actionable insights like risk ratings and recommendations that streamlines compliance and significantly reduces costs and risk around blockchain transactions. Now companies can run complete analysis and compliance for both systems through a single service and do so with a level of efficiency unlike before. So not only does the partnership add a new element to managing risk and compliance for both systems but allows digital currencies and blockchain transactions to be more widely and institutionally adopted while being easier to use for everyone involved.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The two companies are currently integrating solutions and data to jointly begin offering services such as Compliance as a Service for digital currency-related companies, AML/KYC compliance and risk assessment with combined analysis over traditional and blockchain based assets, providing verifiable information for external auditors about blockchain assets, and enhancement of anti-fraud investigations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A combined API is also in the works that is to provide the ultimate compliance solution with complete integration of traditional and blockchain-related assessments.</p>
