<p>Marchex (NASDAQ: MCHX), a leading mobile advertising analytics company, today announced that it is an approved integration partner of DoubleClick Campaign Manager&rsquo;s newly released Conversions API. With this integration, marketers can securely upload Marchex Display Analytics data to DoubleClick and attribute inbound phone calls to digital and mobile advertising programs, providing a more complete view of media performance.</p>
<p>Marketers rely on various digital metrics to measure the success of campaigns, but with both online and offline touchpoints in a consumer&rsquo;s path to purchase, these measurements only offer a partial understanding of a campaign&rsquo;s impact. Marchex Display Analytics enables digital marketers to accurately measure the impact of display and video campaigns on offline sales from calls. With this integration, DoubleClick customers can now take advantage of the rich phone call data that Marchex provides to better understand their customers and campaigns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attributing offline events to our display advertising is an important priority for many of our clients&rdquo;, said Samantha Sowinski, Associate Media Director at iCrossing, a global digital marketing agency. &ldquo;Marchex Display Analytics ties this data together for us, and we look forward to activating this connection within DoubleClick Campaign Manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marchex is dedicated to connecting real-world, offline actions to digital and mobile behavior. The integration with DoubleClick Campaign Manager further validates the need for marketers to have a complete picture of their customers&rsquo; behavior,&rdquo; said Marchex Vice President of Product Engineering, Adarsh Nair. &ldquo;As a preferred partner of DoubleClick&rsquo;s Campaign Manager, we are pleased to offer even more marketers a proven way to garner deeper insight into the customer journey, while improving ROI.&rdquo;</p>
