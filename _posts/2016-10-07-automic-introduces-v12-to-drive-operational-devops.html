<p><em><strong>Agile IT Operations Integral to Driving Digital Transformation</strong></em></p>
<p>Digital transformation is driving the need for agility and speed across organizations of all sizes. DevOps has emerged as a response to fast development of customer facing apps for both web and mobile. Alongside these, enterprises are left grappling with complex, enterprise systems while being told to ârip and replaceâ these backend systems and move them to the cloud.</p>
<p>As a result, traditional enterprises are under tremendous pressure. Automic V12 was built to address these needs and assist IT operations teams in their digital transformation by driving agility across their core business applications, and empowering their DevOps initiatives.</p>
<p>âAs enterprises embrace digital transformation, they are being asked to ârip & replaceâ their core business applications into the cloud,â said Todd DeLaughter, CEO of Automic Software. âWe believe you donât have to throw out all your battle-tested operational know-how in order to increase speed and agility. Automic V12 has been designed for the hybrid enterprise to drive agility across operations, while empowering new DevOps initiativesâ.</p>
