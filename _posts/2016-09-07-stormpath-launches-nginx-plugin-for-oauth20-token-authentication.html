<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_83372_nginxstormpathplugin.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://stormpath.com">Stormpath</a> announced the stormpath-nginx integration, which abstracts token authentication and validation upstream to Nginx. This integration allows API developers to expose OAuth 2.0 at the gateway in front of web and mobile applications and API services.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Nginx is one of the most popular open-source web servers and load balancers, and the integration with Stormpath allows API developers to generate OAuth2.0 access tokens for API services. Much like Nginx's other benefits - load balancing, caching, and monitoring - abstracted token authentication reduces the complexity of API management and development.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additionally, managing API access with Stormpath allows developers to leverage a shared user store, with authentication and authorization capabilities, across multiple services. The stormpath-nginx integration augments Stormpath's existing offerings for API authentication: API key management and Token Authentication.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"At Stormpath, we care - a lot - about the craft of API development. We want to help developers focus on building robust, intuitive and scalable APIs, and let go of the worry and hassle of authenticating those services. Regardless of what kind of APIs you build, you probably donât want to leave them open for anyone to call. Authenticating the caller is still necessary," said Tom Abbott, Stormpath Head of Product.</p>
