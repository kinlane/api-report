For users, this means UX that captivates, and a doubling in dwell time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">When trading, and doing personal banking, users don&rsquo;t have time to waste by pressing a button to refresh a screen. <a href="http://4m0h.mj.is/link/4m0h/y6wqxs18gh6/4/FZxzqD7YhtX3Zt95fVOt8A/aHR0cDovL3N0cmVhbWRhdGEuaW8v"><span class="s1">Streamdata.io</span></a> offers an effective service that will increase the order confirmation rate by providing current market information to clients. "Real- time UX is real time money," &nbsp;Eric Horesnyi, <a href="http://streamdata.io/"><span class="s3">Streamdata.io</span></a>, CEO, on his vision of the financial API revolution.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Real-time data is crucial in many sectors, especially finance. By providing data directly from market APIs to end users, <a href="http://streamdata.io/"><span class="s3">Streamdata.io</span></a> cuts inefficiencies associated with intermediary components: tromboning, bottlenecks and proprietary protocols, targeting a 500ms global dissemination of information. Although its CEO worked with people in &ldquo;Flash Boys,&rdquo; a book on High Frequency Trading by Michael Lewis, <a href="http://streamdata.io/"><span class="s3">Streamdata.io</span></a> focuses on the algorithmic and day-trader time range of hundreds of milliseconds to minutes, where information asymmetry hits most orders today. Compared to traditional architecture, <a href="http://streamdata.io/"><span class="s3">Streamdata.io</span></a> benchmarks shows offload of server CPU, and of outbound network by up to 99%.</span></p>
