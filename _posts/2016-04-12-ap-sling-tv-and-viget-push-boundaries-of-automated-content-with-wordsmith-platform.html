<p><a href="https://automatedinsights.com/">Automated Insights</a>, the creator of the Wordsmith platform that automates the writing process, today announced that the results of several experimental hackathon sessions have expanded the possibilities for automated content in business.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Associated Press, which has partnered with Automated Insights since 2014 to automate corporate earnings stories, was one of the first companies to trial the new self-service Wordsmith platform using federal unemployment data. AP currently reports on the monthly unemployment rate for many states, but it isn&rsquo;t able to provide that coverage for all U.S. states. AP is now using Wordsmith to see how it may automatically generate data-rich stories for all states each month.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Wordsmith allows you to make the if/then decisions that a reporter would make when writing a story,&rdquo; said Barry Bedlan, an AP Deputy Director and one of the organization&rsquo;s proponents of automation. &ldquo;By mapping out the editorial decisions in advance, it can be used to quickly cover most scenarios and then make any changes as needed. Ultimately, I can see how Wordsmith can be used for expanded coverage at an unprecedented speed and scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In another session, Sling TV, the live and on-demand Internet television service, rapidly prototyped personalized messaging to showcase the broad library of live and on-demand content available through the service to current and potential customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Finally, Automated Insights partnered with digital agency Viget to test how designers and developers could integrate Wordsmith into other business and consumer technologies with the Wordsmith API, which is fast enough to generate text instantly from these types of applications. In just one business day, the Viget team built an automated &ldquo;robot DJ&rdquo; to create talkbackfm.com. Using Wordsmith, the team turned song and artist data into text to bookend pieces of music. The Wordsmith narrative was then converted from text to speech.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Since opening up our Wordsmith platform to everyone, we&rsquo;ve been anticipating innovative implementations we never would have thought of,&rdquo; said Ai CEO and Founder Robbie Allen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting to see external teams using our platform to take automated content in new directions to create unprecedented value.&rdquo;</p>
