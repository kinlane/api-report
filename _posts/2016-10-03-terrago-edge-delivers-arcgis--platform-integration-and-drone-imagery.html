<p><a href="http://www.terragotech.com/">TerraGo</a>, a pioneer of geospatial collaboration, field data collection and enterprise mobility software, announces the availability of TerraGo Edge 3.9.6 with a number of new, powerful features for iOS&reg;, Android&reg; and web users. These new features are also immediately available with the TerraGo Magic zero-code platform as a service, which lets end users build custom apps without any code, at a fraction of the cost of traditional development.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"The latest updates to TerraGo Edge already include features based on recent feedback from both our office and field teams." said Matthew Colvin, Junior Team Lead, Corrosion Service. "With some big software vendors, you submit request forms, send support emails, and wait months or years, if ever, to see a requested feature. TerraGo's customer-driven, agile process keeps us in the loop so we see rapid delivery of high-impact capabilities for our projects."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our innovation is a direct result of focusing on the speed of getting the best ideas from our customers&rsquo; operations into our app features,&rdquo; said Dave Basil, Vice President of Product Development at TerraGo. &ldquo;Whether it&rsquo;s their field users looking for efficiency or the IT stakeholder that needs to integrate with back-end systems, our fast-paced collaboration means our customers get powerful, new features faster and that keeps them ahead of their competition.&rdquo;</p>
