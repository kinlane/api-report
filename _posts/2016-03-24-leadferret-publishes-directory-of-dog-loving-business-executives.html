<p>Dogs are still America's pet of choice with approximately 78.8 million households owning one or more dogs, down from last years 83.3 million households. When it comes to vacations and family outings, dogs have more fun. In 75% of dog owning households the dog is treated to rides in the family car compared with 8 % of cats who get to ride along. In addition 34% of households surveyed reported that the dog goes along on family vacations, in contrast to only to only 11% who bring the cat along.</p>
