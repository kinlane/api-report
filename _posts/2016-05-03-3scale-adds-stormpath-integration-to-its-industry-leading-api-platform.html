The combined capabilities simplify adoption of the complicated OAuth authentication flow, and continue to make 3scale the best platform on which to build OAuth-powered APIs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">The Stormpath integration is a powerful tool for any API provider who needs identity management. Via the integration, and with the code accessible on Github, customers simply &ldquo;copy and paste&rdquo; code to use Stormpath and 3scale together. By providing complete identity management for 3scale customers, the partnership brings radical simplicity to modern app development. This Stormpath integration is available beginning today as a no-cost option with all 3scale plans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">&ldquo;The integration with Stormpath is the latest step from 3scale in becoming the standard for sophisticated APIs,&rdquo; said Steve Willmott, CEO of 3scale. &ldquo;We know that, due to the complexity of today&rsquo;s development, in-house options are less feasible. This new partnership will make it easier than ever for API providers to implement a complete identity layer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">&nbsp;&ldquo;OAuth presents API developers with a complex challenge &ndash; it&rsquo;s complicated and labor-intensive to implement and secure,&rdquo; said Alex Salazar, Stormpath CEO. &ldquo;This partnership between Stormpath and 3scale makes it easy for API providers to quickly deliver reliable APIs with best-in-class security, authentication and identity management."</span></p>
