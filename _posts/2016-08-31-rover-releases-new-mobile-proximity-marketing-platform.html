<p><a href="https://www.rover.io">Rover</a>, an innovator in location-based mobile marketing, has launched an enhanced version of its platform &ndash; the first to incorporate every tool that brands and retailers need to create and run location-driven marketing campaigns for their mobile apps. The new platform eliminates the complexities of location-driven marketing by bringing together all of the tools in one place, making it easy for marketers and app publishers to design and deliver effective location-based campaigns.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Location-driven marketing is becoming a top priority for brands and retailers, but the market has lacked an uncomplicated, end-to-end solution that marketers can use to turn beacon hardware and geofences into engaging mobile experiences. Rover&rsquo;s new platform integrates all of the features and tools needed to create those experiences, from managing location infrastructure to designing rich native content to running location-triggered campaigns.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We redesigned our platform from the ground up with one overriding goal &ndash; make executing location-based campaigns intuitive and scalable, so every marketer can jump right in and start capitalizing on location,&rdquo; said Rover CEO John Coombs. &ldquo;By making it look and feel familiar to marketers, and bringing together all of the tools under one roof, we&rsquo;ve removed major barriers to adoption.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Also new with the Rover platform is a clean and approachable interface that compartmentalizes each set of tools by role, with five main apps within the Rover dashboard where each user can perform their associated tasks, including:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Proximity &ndash; App for IT to configure their beacon and geofence infrastructure. Supports integrations with all major beacon brands, and can now import all types of beacons and their configurations directly into the platform. Also new is smart tagging for assigning relevant labels to beacons and geofences, making them easier to identify, manage and target at a later date (e.g. target all beacons tagged &lsquo;urban store&rsquo; vs. beacon #123).</li>
<li>Customers &ndash; App for marketers to create and segment their audience based on location data and set rules for engaging them. Includes new functionality to build location-centric customer segments (e.g. customer who hasn&rsquo;t been inside a store in 45 days). It&rsquo;s also API driven, so can easily integrate with existing CMS and CRM solutions.</li>
<li>Messages &ndash; App for marketers to build and deploy their mobile proximity marketing campaigns within minutes with no coding required. Can implement both location-triggered and standard push messaging campaigns. The enhanced platform includes a new advanced rules engine for setting sophisticated logic around who gets a message and when (e.g. when customer exits a beacon, if customer dwells in geofence for an hour, to a maximum four messages per month).</li>
<li>Experiences &ndash; App for designers to create rich location-triggered mobile experiences &ndash; such as video, brand experiences, or interactive quizzes. Using this browser-based tool, designers can build native content that can be deployed immediately with no coding or app store approval required.</li>
<li>Analytics &ndash; App for data and business intelligence analysts to review visit data and campaign performance, including open and click rates, to determine which messages and content performed best and inform future campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Usability was one of the main forces behind this unique, roles-based interface design,&rdquo; said Coombs. &ldquo;By giving each type of user a place to &lsquo;live&rsquo; in the platform, each set of functionalities is focused and easy to navigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Rover serves as the missing link between beacon hardware and mobile engagement. Customers such as the Pittsburgh Penguins and Proctor &amp; Gamble use the platform to create and deliver location-relevant information to their app users that enhance their on-site experiences and influence customer behaviors. Rover&rsquo;s SDK is open source and compatible with iOS and Android.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Rover offers Professional and Enterprise subscription plans for its location-based mobile marketing platform, depending on the size and needs of the business. Find more information at https://www.rover.io/features or request a demo.</p>
