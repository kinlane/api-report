The updated functionality will provide developers with improved integration methods and easy, one-click âGo Liveâ access.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Building on its full-service developer portal that went live in March, Hyperwalletâs new implementation methods make it easy for marketplace and platform developers to test Hyperwalletâs payout functionality through a suite of API integrations and user-friendly UI widgets. Additionally, new âGo Liveâ functionality makes it easy for developers to expedite the real-world implementation of their payout solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âHyperwalletâs developer portal and API integrations are world class,â explained Ernie Naylor, President at Karrot Rewards. âTheir documentation, webhooks, and user-friendly portal made it easy for us to integrate, test, and quickly get up and running.â An early adopter of Hyperwalletâs Developer Program, Karrot uses REST APIs to disburse payments directly to its loyalty program usersâ local bank accounts.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Hyperwalletâs Chief Product Officer, Bill Crowley, will provide additional details on how engineers can implement frictionless global payouts during a workshop presentation at API World on September 13 at 4:00PM PST. Blair Olynyk, Hyperwalletâs Lead Software Architect, will also be presenting at the conference on the same day, explaining how companies invested in SOA or monolithic architecture can transition to a microservice architecture. Attendees can join his presentation at 2:20PM PST on the main stage.</p>
