<p>React Mobile, a leading personal safety platform with a range of safety products for the enterprise, today announced the release of the React Mobile API, providing the development community at large with access to React Mobile features and data. Using the new API, developers building wearables, apps and other platforms can leverage the React Mobile safety platform and add widespread SOS alerting capabilities to their products.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consumers everywhere want safety included in their devices,&rdquo; said Robb Monkman, Founder and CEO of React Mobile. &ldquo;Now mobile app developers and hardware designers can use our API to provide their users with the features and functionality of the React Mobile platform. We&rsquo;ve already conducted a private beta of our API with the Amazon Echo and several wearables, so we&rsquo;re excited so see how the development community at large integrates our technology with other apps, connected devices or platforms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>React Mobile&rsquo;s personal safety solution turns any smartphone into a powerful lifeline. The company has developed a mobile panic button, called The React Sidekick, that pairs with the React Mobile safety app via LE Bluetooth. With a single click of the Sidekick, users can activate the app and issue an SOS alert for immediate emergency assistance, even when their phone screen is locked or their phone is out of reach. The React Mobile safety app&rsquo;s &ldquo;Follow-Me&rdquo; feature shares the user&rsquo;s location with friends, family, administrators or colleagues, enabling them to track the user&rsquo;s whereabouts in real-time and follow him or her to safety.</p>
<p>The company also recently released the React Dispatch Console, a software solution designed exclusively for companies, universities, or other professional organizations responsible for the safety of their employees or private community. The React Dispatch Console helps corporate security professionals quickly identify incidents, shorten response times, document events &ndash; and ensure the safety of everyone under their protection.</p>
<p>The React Dispatch Console combines alert management, computer aided dispatch, and incident reporting in one central application for improved situational awareness and faster response times. GPS-enabled maps allow safety personnel to visualize where incidents are occurring in real-time, enabling quicker response and greater visibility during critical events. Once incidents have been identified, responded to, and documented, the React Dispatch Console&rsquo;s advanced analytics also help security professionals identify location-specific incident trends or patterns, strengthening preventive safety measures.</p>
<p>React Mobile provides fully-customized branding opportunities for businesses and institutions &ndash; including branded apps, Dispatch Console, and panic buttons with name, color, logo and user interface customizations.</p>
