<p><a href="http://www.inkrouter.com/">InkRouter</a>, a print procurement software solution for web-to-print storefronts, is introducing even more materials and products to its print offerings. Newly formed partnerships from SGIA Expo 16, a trade show for the imaging industry held Sept. 14-16, effectively expand the custom printing capabilities of InkRouter&rsquo;s global network of print providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">InkRouter will be working with 14 regional manufacturing facilities throughout the continental U.S. to provide consumers with a wider array of custom print products. Added options will include fully customizable coffee mugs printed on a high-volume, direct-to-garment sublimation oven as well as custom T-shirts in several qualities and sizes.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The print procurement automation software uses bi-directional API technology to facilitate print orders between print providers and print resellers. Its algorithmic adaptive intelligence matches orders to print providers within the network based on JDF/CIP4 compatible XML definitions. The API service is currently provided at no charge to the industry.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">InkRouter recently presented its software for print at Graph Expo 16, the premier event for the graphic communications industry held Sept. 25-28 in Orlando, Fla.</p>
