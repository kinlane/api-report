<p>Fiorano today announced the launch of its enterprise-class open source ESB (Enterprise service bus). With all the features required for&nbsp;enterprise scaleintegration projects, Fiorano ESB Community allows users to employ any open source or proprietary JMS engine as a message transport providing tremendous development flexibility. The Fiorano Open Source ESB is licensed under a modified Common Public Attribution License (CPAL).</p>
<p>Fiorano open source ESB is a mature and established commercial product which is moving to open source. Unlike other open source ESBs which evolved from community driven projects, Fiorano ESB Community is an open-source version of an established commercial integration platform, allowing truly &ldquo;enterprise grade&rdquo; technology to be accessed by the global developer community for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a microservice-centric development model, productive composition tools and a distributed, scalable cloud-enabled architecture, Fiorano brings the ultimate integration technology into the hands of the global development community&rdquo;, said Atul Saini,&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;and CTO of Fiorano. &ldquo;Projects can now be completed with half the programmers in half the time as compared to previous approaches by both open-source and commercial products&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Fiorano ESB Community enables application integration by choreographing Microservices into asynchronous flows via Fiorano Studio and associated tools catering to the requirements of both citizen integrators and integration specialists. It also includes a Microservices toolkit that enables the development of message-driven Microservices in a number of supported languages including Java, C,&nbsp;C++&nbsp;and C#. It uses a wire-level protocol called the Component Control Protocol (CCP), which allows asynchronous communication between the Fiorano ESB server and microservices being choreographed/orchestrated into application flows.</p>
