Through its partnership with AdRoll, Springbotâs Facebook and Instagram retargeting capabilities will allow Magento and Shopify retailers to build highly customizable static or dynamic ads based on website visitor and customer data uniquely available within the Springbot dashboard.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With Springbotâs retargeting functionality, retailers can now personalize Facebook and Instagram ads â featuring products relevant to that customerâs past purchases or recently viewed content on the retailerâs website. Ultimately, by offering customized ads to the right individuals across highly targeted channels â like Facebook and Instagram â retailers can increase view-through and click-through rates and convert more online window shoppers into buyers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âUnlike a lot of other marketing tactics, behavioral retargeting is geared towards customers at the middle and bottom of the funnel and helps close the sale,â said Erika Jolly Brookes, CMO at Springbot. âIn fact, with only two percent of first time site traffic converting, behavior based retargeting plays a key role in providing the omnichannel marketing solutions marketers must use across social and digital channels to grow their business.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Springbotâs intuitive dashboard gives retailers access to easily track site and store conversions from social as well as web site retargeting efforts. They can seamlessly make changes by uploading and building both dynamic and static ad campaigns within the Springbot platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWeâre excited to provide the core technology to help our partner Springbot bring cutting edge functionality like retargeting with dynamic ad creative to their customer base,â said Adam Berke, president and CMO of AdRoll. âAPI partnerships like this are a great way for AdRoll to stay true to our mission, to build the most powerful marketing platform through performance, usability, and openness.â</p>
