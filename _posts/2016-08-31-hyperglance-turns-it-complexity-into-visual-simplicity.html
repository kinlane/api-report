<p><a href="http://www.hyperglance.com">Hyperglance Ltd</a>., the first to utilize gaming quality graphics for real-time 3D IT topology insight, today released Hyperglance version 4.1. Hyperglance 4.1 combats the complexity of monitoring today&rsquo;s vast array of loosely coupled, widely distributed, virtual and physical, IT infrastructure by providing context-rich visual insight and control through a unified view. Hyperglance automatically discovers, aggregates, and maps otherwise disparate data into an interactive, cross-platform, 3D topology visualization. Hyperglance 4.1 comes pre-integrated with VMware vSphere&reg;, Docker&reg; Swarm, Kubernetes, Amazon Web Services&trade; (AWS), OpenStack&reg;, SNMP Networking platforms and Nagios&reg; monitored devices for a cohesive visibility layer within minutes. Monitoring data, such as alerts and metrics, is included for a complete visual perspective at any level. Direct resource connection and menu driven actions are also available through Hyperglance for immediate context-aware troubleshooting. Users can effortlessly map, monitor, manage and understand their current infrastructure resources&rsquo; state, health, and relationships that exist within and across Hyperglance integrated platforms. Also included is a comprehensive REST API to extend visibility with additional data. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Hyperglance is offering an innovative approach that can help IT organizations address the fact that they miss 40% of infrastructure problems and only find out about them after users complain.&rdquo; said Shamus McGillicuddy, Sr. Analyst, Enterprise Management Associates (EMA)</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Hyperglance is the only tool that provides an interactive cross-platform 3D topology visualization with 360-degree clarity, context-rich data analysis and direct resource controls through the same intuitive browser screen. Hyperglance automatically maintains a current view that can be securely accessed and easily assessed by users of varying skill levels on varying client devices.</p>
