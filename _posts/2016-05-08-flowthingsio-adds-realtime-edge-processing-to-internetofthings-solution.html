<p><a href="https://flowthings.io/">flowthings.io</a> today announced the availability of comprehensive edge processing and data orchestration for Internet-of-Things solutions. The company&rsquo;s new Edge Execution Engine now executes processing, filtering and intelligent routing capabilities within edge gateways and devices&mdash;complementing previously released cloud processing capabilities. flowthings.io is the first IoT platform to offer real-time data orchestration on both the Edge and in the Cloud, all available on-demand and programmable from the same drag-and-drop web interface.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The internet-of-things is an emerging ecosystem where innumerable sensors, devices and gateways gather and communicate real-time data to a wildly heterogeneous universe of apps, visualizations, analytics, databases and systems of record,&rdquo; said Eric Alterman, flowthings.io CEO. &ldquo;By enabling real-time event processing, data orchestration, routing, and interoperability between vendor solutions at the edge and in the cloud, flowthings.io becomes the nervous system that connects entire IoT ecosystems, uniting isolated data silos.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Dell IoT revealed their partnership with Flowthings in a separate announcement this week (Dell Press Release). As a complete edge and cloud data orchestration solution, flowthings.io executes real-time processing instructions within edge devices like the Dell Edge Gateway 5000, making IoT data immediately actionable and interoperable with other edge services and analytic solutions (Dell IoT Solutions Partners).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">flowthings.io provides developers on-demand access to APIs and drag-and-drop workflow tools. The solution executes instructions at the edge and in the cloud, including the ability to enrich incoming data with other enterprise and cloud data sources. Using drag-and-drop workflow tools or simple javascript programming, developers can apply rules that create thresholds, normalize or redact data, or conditionally route data between any number of external apps, solutions and devices. IoT solutions that span the edge, fog, and cloud are delivered in hours as compared to the months required using traditional solutions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our Edge Execution Engine is a huge step forward in our expansion into fog computing,&rdquo; said Tom Luczak, flowthings.io&rsquo;s CTO. "When paired with our lightweight agent, the new execution engine eliminates the need for stovepipe, one-off glue code to connect sensors, actuators, and services, along with its associated operational overhead. This advanced solution enables any edge node to securely and dynamically deploy event-processing, analytics, and data orchestration capabilities from a single cloud connection&rdquo;, said Luczak. &ldquo;Developers can simply register for an account, create a device, and download the appropriate agent to start orchestrating data flows within an edge device.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Workflows can now be dynamically deployed and executed at the edge via flowthings.io's lightweight, edge-optimized extension. Developers now can graphically build, test, and deploy real-time workflows that combine both cloud and edge execution when required. Edge workflows can seamlessly orchestrate data flow between many existing services and sensors at the edge or can be forwarded to the cloud via the flowthings.io agent. The flowthings.io agent is a self-contained executable that is currently available for any gateway devices running Linux or Darwin operating systems on a 386, AMD64, ARM6, or ARM7 architecture.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About flowthings.io &ndash;</strong> Based in Brooklyn, NY, flowthings.io is an advanced IoT platform for real-time data workflow and orchestration at both the edge and in the cloud. flowthings.io works with leading technology companies to deliver optimal real-time solutions for numerous industry verticals&mdash;from asset management and transportation to smart cities and agriculture.</p>
