<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apievangelistsitenewsdynamsoft-barcode-readerpng" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.dynamsoft.com">Dynamsoft</a> has made available a software development kit (SDK) for AppleÂ® iOS developers to easily integrate barcode scanning into their apps to turn iPhones into enterprise-grade barcode scanning tools. The new SDK supports 1D and 2D barcode reading. Developers can integrate barcode scanning in as little as a few minutes using just a few lines of code. This builds on Dynamsoftâs barcode reader SDKs for desktop and web applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Dynamsoftâs Barcode Reader for iOS SDK supports reading single barcodes from images and smartphone cameras. Synchronous and asynchronous barcode decoding are supported. The SDK works with iOS 7, 8 or 9 and iPhoneÂ® 4S and above. Valid architectures are armv7/arm64/i386/x86_64. It reads bar codes without a quiet zone and decodes bar codes printed on various surfaces. This includes passports, ID cards, vehicle identification numbers (VIN), boxes, documents, and more. Supported 1D barcode types include Code 39, Code 128, Code 93, Codabar, Interleaved 2 of 5, Industrial 2 of 5, EAN-13, EAN-8, UPC-A, and UPC-E. Supported 2D barcodes include QRCode, DATAMATRIX, and PDF417.</p>
