The Safety Critical Advisory Panel will be open to both Khronos members and invited experts from the industry. Markets such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), autonomous vehicles, robotics and avionics increasingly need advanced acceleration APIs that are designed to provide reliable operation and enable system safety certification. The guidelines will be openly published and adopted as part of Khronosâ proven API design process. Experienced practitioners in the field of safety critical system design are invited to apply for Advisory Panel membership, at no cost, with more details at the Khronos Safety Critical working group page.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âVisual computing acceleration will be a vital component of many emerging safety critical markets, and so the industry needs a new generation of hardware APIs that enable access to advanced silicon capabilities in certifiable systems,â said Neil Trevett, president of the Khronos Group and vice president at NVIDIA. âThe Safety Critical Advisory Panel will build on the experience of creating the new generation OpenGL SC 2.0 API, plus we are inviting industry experts to assist in creating pragmatic guidelines to enable effective safety critical API design - both within Khronos and throughout the industry.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In April 2016, Khronos released the OpenGL SC 2.0 API specification to address the unique and stringent requirements of high reliability display system markets, including FAA DO-178C and EASA ED-12C Level A for avionics, and ISO 26262 safety standards for automotive. OpenGL SC 2.0 enables high reliability system manufacturers to take advantage of modern graphics programmable shader engines while still achieving the highest levels of safety certification. Khronos expects that several additional Khronos working groups, including Vulkan, OpenCL and OpenVX will adopt the safety critical guidelines when designing future APIs that will enable similar levels of certification.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About The Khronos Group </strong><br />The Khronos Group is an industry consortium creating open standards to enable the authoring and acceleration of parallel computing, graphics, vision, sensor processing and dynamic media on a wide variety of platforms and devices. Khronos standards include Vulkanâ¢, OpenGLÂ®, OpenGLÂ® ES, WebGLâ¢, OpenCLâ¢, SPIRâ¢, SPIR-Vâ¢, SYCLâ¢, WebCLâ¢, OpenVXâ¢, EGLâ¢, COLLADAâ¢, and glTFâ¢. All Khronos members are enabled to contribute to the development of Khronos specifications, are empowered to vote at various stages before public deployment, and are able to accelerate the delivery of their cutting-edge media platforms and applications through early access to specification drafts and conformance tests.</p>
