In addition, LoginRadius can support tens of thousands of registrations and logins per second per customer and store more than 100 million user records for each customer.</li>
<li>High Performance: LoginRadius has already achieved an impressive 100 percent uptime record and will strive towards maintaining this record going forward along with reaching an API response time that is faster than 200 milliseconds.</li>
<li>PII Regulations Compliant: Microsoft Azure meets key industry standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27018, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, and SOC 1 and SOC 2. These are in addition to country-specific guidelines like EU Model Clauses, UK G-Cloud, Singapore MTCS and Australia CCSL.</li>
<li>Regional Data Storage: The global reach of Microsoft Azure with 20 datacenters spread across the world allows businesses to store data locally and comply with relevant privacy laws.</li>
