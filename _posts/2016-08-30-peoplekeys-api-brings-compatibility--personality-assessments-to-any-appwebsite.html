<p><a href="https://peoplekeys.com/">PeopleKeys</a> API was designed to improve the functionality of applications and websites of businesses, coaches, job boards, dating websites, phone apps and more. The API can be customized to include the branding of another website or application.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Dr. Brad Smith of PeopleKeys comments on the impact of this new technology, &ldquo;We had a client who was delivering a Learning Management System to the National Weather Service. As part of the Learning Management System, it really helped to know the individual's personal style and preferences in communication. Through this seamless application, our client&rsquo;s LMS now offers an enhanced way of delivering learning content.&rdquo; Smith adds, &ldquo;We have also provided the ability to match job seekers with applicants. It looks at how soft skills impact hiring as much (or more than) hard skills, especially as they are related to sales and customer service.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Ashley Kulkin, Director of Operations for PeopleKeys, agreed. &ldquo;No other Behavioral Analysis expert or DISC provider can offer this level of functionality. PeopleKeys allows everyone from an individual coach or trainer to a multinational corporation to integrate customized Behavioral Analysis and personality assessments into their site. Customers or clients will be able to take a DISC report or other assessment without needing to log in to another website or start an account with PeopleKeys or ever even realize that they aren&rsquo;t on the website for the company they clicked on,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Essentially, with PeopleKeys API and customization options, a coach or business can offer personality assessments and compatibility directly through their site or app. It means that our website will talk to any website."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The upgraded API will allow for nearly infinite customization options, which can help businesses to seamlessly incorporate personality assessments into their own interface. The behavioral assessments accessible through this API include, but are not limited to: personality profiles, compatibility reports, career and hiring profiles, student skills analyses, occupational strengths profiles and many more.</p>
