<p><a href="http://www.sigmaflow.com">SigmaFlow</a>, a leading provider of compliance process execution solutions for NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) and 693 compliance management, today announced workflow templates that help to expedite the deployment of SigmaFlow&rsquo;s NERC CIP Compliance Manager to better adhere to the NERC CIP v5 standard requirements. SigmaFlow&rsquo;s current Compliance Manager customer-base consists of utilities in the US and Canada, varying in size from very large publicly owned utilities to smaller cooperatives and municipalities&ndash; with representation in each of the eight NERC regions. The SigmaFlow NERC CIP v5 model provides preconfigured functionality that automates and streamlines the collection of evidence, document management and data-driven reporting required to adhere to the NERC CIP v5 standards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The April 2016 deadline, which requires utilities to adhere to the NERC CIP v5 standards, adds many new and redefined compliance expectations for electric utilities. The challenge of transitioning from version 3 to version 5 can be complicated and often costly for utilities that are not adequately prepared. There are also many utilities coming under CIP for the first time due to the new brightline impact criteria in v5, requiring them to build an entire CIP program to prove their adherence to the standards, with processes in place to ensure their audit readiness.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SigmaFlow&rsquo;s Compliance Manager provides a comprehensive platform for NERC compliance that includes Document Management, RSAW Automation, Data Management, Recurring Schedule Management, Workflow, Dashboards, Reporting and Integration. The automated platform provides utilities and renewables with a reliable solution to handle the complexities of managing and adhering to the NERC CIP standards and maintaining audit readiness.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The SigmaFlow platform&rsquo;s 36 workflow templates provide customers with substantial flexibility. Customers can implement the pre-configured workflow templates to expedite meeting compliance deadlines and then adjust to align with specific company processes. Alternatively, customers can choose a custom deployment option and work with SigmaFlow partners or their own consultants to develop unique processes. Once deployed, the SigmaFlow solution automatically kicks-off recurring compliance work items as they come due with pre-built compliance workflows that enforce compliance rules and generate/collect the evidence that proves compliance.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our Compliance Manager solution enables utilities to work smart and automate the processes to comprehensively manage NERC CIP compliance,&rdquo; said Terry Schurter, vice president of NERC Solutions at SigmaFlow. &ldquo;We have automated a lot of the heavy lifting associated with RSAW generation, change management, access management and evidence collection, and also removed the burden of keeping up with the changing standards through regular content updates.&rdquo;</p>
