<p><a href="http://www.clickpay.com">ClickPay</a>, a leading provider of billing and payment solutions for the real estate industry, announced the launch of a new fully electronic solution to streamline the process of accepting payments at the time of lease such as application fees, security deposits, and first months rent. The new web application was built with software developer, Open Box and it enables mobile and online payments for applicants to quickly close leases. All transactions are integrated directly into the Accounts Receivable process, starting with the resident guest card and carrying through the application process all the way to lease execution and payment posting in MRI. Part of the value is eliminating all manual data entry and automatically routing funds to designated bank accounts based on transaction type and property. Itemized charges such as application fees, first month&rsquo;s rent, and security deposits are created on the resident guest card in MRI by the leasing team and completed payments are then credited against these charges on the resident ledger. To complete the lease, the resident is invited to pay electronically by Credit Card on their mobile device. Options for payment by ACH and paper check are also supported.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;When PCVST came to us with the idea of an end-to-end integrated leasing solution that accepts payments, we immediately realized that others in the industry could use a solution like this. The result is a great product built for leasing teams; allowing them to process payments at the time of lease in order to remove the friction and speed up the closing process. The ability to take Security Deposits and related fees with a Credit Card closes the time-gap of sending the Applicant to the bank to get a cashier's check, and ensures that the whole process can be completed without the applicant leaving the office&rdquo; states Aaron Sheklin, CIO.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Keeping the process paperless removes all the manual processes involved. The leasing process has been reduced from days to hours,&rdquo; says Gregg Haverstick, Senior Director IT, PCVST.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This resulting product is built on a platform that quickly and easily integrates with any accounting platform through an API. The secure program can be customized to meet the workflow of many large property management clients ClickPay currently serves.</p>
