Now in its eighth year, the annual SINET 16 competition included leading companies from nine different countries and 82 companies. During the SINET Showcase on November 2-3, 2016, in Washington D.C., each of the SINET 16 Innovators will present on how their technology represents innovative and cutting-edge solutions to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities and threats. ThreatQuotientâs CEO John Czupak will be on hand to explain ThreatQâs strengths as a leading threat intelligence platform (TIP) and outline its unique advantages over competitors.</p>
<p>âThe designation of SINET 16 Innovator is a coveted title for emerging technology companies, and ThreatQuotient is proud to receive this recognition among a global community of incredibly innovative competition,â said Czupak. âOur team believes that the foundation of intelligence-driven security is people, and we will continue to seek new ways to improve our threat intelligence platform to help analysts leverage their threat data in the best way possible.â</p>
<p>ThreatQuotient has built ThreatQ, an open and extensible TIP to enable analysts and defenders to be more effective and efficient. ThreatQ provides the context, customization and collaboration required to transform threat data into threat intelligence, while giving analysts control over the process. With ThreatQ, analysts leverage a threat library, an adaptive workbench and an open API exchange to provide threat intelligence that is more timely, accurate and relevant to their business.</p>
<p>âI am proud and excited to recognize ThreatQuotient as one of this yearâs SINET 16 Innovators,â said Robert Rodriguez, Chairman and Founder of SINET. âOf our four programs each year, Silicon Valley, New York City, Washington D.C. and London, the Showcase is my favorite as it has a clear deliverable in our mission to advance innovation in the cybersecurity domain.â</p>
<p>The 2016 SINET 16 applications were made up of competitive early stage and emerging technologies. Each entry was evaluated in a two-stage process by the SINET Showcase Steering Committee, which was comprised of 100 cybersecurity professionals, including CISOs from leading organizations worldwide, experts in government intelligence and defense agencies, distinguished venture capital firms specializing in security, security entrepreneurs and security experts from academia. Recognized by SINET for its innovative approach to enabling analysts to accelerate the transformation of threat data into threat intelligence, ThreatQ is a turnkey integration that can harness and take advantage of information as quickly as possible.</p>
