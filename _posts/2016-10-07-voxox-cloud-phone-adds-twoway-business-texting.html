<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_87877_app_bg4.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.voxox.com">Voxox</a>, innovator in cloud communication solutions for businesses with the most comprehensive Unified Communications Platform as a Service, today announced that it has included two-way texting at no additional cost for all customers subscribed to Cloud Phone, the cloud-based virtual phone system for entrepreneurs and very small businesses. The paid subscription plans, which range from 1,000 to 5,000 minutes per month, will now also include between 1,000 to 5,000 free text messages per month, depending on the plan. Popular virtual PBX services typically do not include two-way texting within their monthly calling plans without extra charges or fees. The inclusion of free SMS for Cloud Phone customers is in line with Voxox's strategy to differentiate its services by providing the best business value.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Two-way SMS has been our most requested feature for Cloud Phone with 60 percent of customers indicating in surveys their desire to add business texting to their accounts," said Bryan Hertz, CEO and co-founder of Voxox. "Not only did we add the feature but we also included it for free with all Cloud Phone calling plans, which is unorthodox in our space. Our goal with Cloud Phone is to disrupt the marketplace with innovative features and unique offers that empower micro-businesses."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Cloud Phone enables âmicro-businessesâ (businesses that operate on a very small scale), as well as individuals and small organizations seeking a business-grade telephone presence, to easily obtain local and toll free numbers that support up to 25 extensions and advanced call routing capabilities. With Cloud Phone, users can place and receive calls, manage call activity, access features such as voicemail transcription, call recording, device transfer, faxing, and much more -- all within a sleek, elegant design. No special equipment or advanced skills are necessary to use Cloud Phone. Once a Do It Yourself (DIY) set-up is completed online, all that a user needs is a calling device (e.g., mobile or landline phone) to which calls can be routed. The effortless user experience and set-up process, which can be completed in less than a minute, along with highly competitive global calling rates and exceptional call quality, are key differentiators as compared to alternative solutions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Cloud Phone comes with a complementary mobile app for iOS and Android. The Cloud Phone mobile app leverages Voxox's new breakthrough VoIP codec, a technology used to encode and compress voice signals into digital form for transmission. This is particularly significant for small businesses with a disbursed or traveling workforce, as the codec dramatically improves voice quality in poor bandwidth settings, such as hotels, convention centers, rural locations, etc. To hear the dramatic difference visit, http://www.voxox.com/codecdemo.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Apart from two-way business texting available through Cloud Phone, Voxox also offers wholesale SMS services for text-enabling business communications through a web service API. More information available at http://www.voxox.com/business/sms.</p>
