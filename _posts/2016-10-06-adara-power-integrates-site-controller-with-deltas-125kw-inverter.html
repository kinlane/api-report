By integrating its iC3 Platform with Deltaâs new scalable 480VAC/125kW Power Conditioning System, Adara Power extends its energy intelligence solutions to commercial-scale applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Based on Adaraâs automotive control system and battery management semiconductor heritage, the Adara iC3 Platform tightly integrates battery and inverter controls with cloud-based software and a robust IoT connectivity solution. At the heart of the iC3 Platform is the Adara iC3 Controller â an intelligent hardware and firmware device that acts as the primary communication interface and runs the control algorithms.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe are glad that Adara Power integrated their new iC3 Platform with Deltaâs Power Conditioning System to provide customers with a flexible controls system on top of our industry-leading Power Conditioning System,â said Mike Lin, VP Sales and Product Management of Delta. âThe coupling of sophisticated controls with advanced power electronics is critical to unlock the full value of commercial energy storage that complies with a wide range of state and utility requirements.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The 125kW Delta Power Conditioning System offers exciting and innovative features to simplify installation, such as integrated AC/DC switches, while delivering peak high-efficiency of 97.8%. By coupling the Adara iC3 Controller and iC3 Platform software, this solution includes dynamic controls based on site inputs, remote updates to keep up with changing tariff schedules and building loads, ease of installation and commissioning, as well as extensive reports and monitoring. The Adara iC3 Controller provides the higher-level decision making to balance multiple use cases and revenue streams, as well as ensuring the long life of the lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe commercial market demands intelligent energy storage that has operational flexibility, industrial-grade reliability and durability, and open APIs for integration with building management systems and grid service providers,â said Neil Maguire, CEO of Adara Power. âAdara Power is now able to extend our core battery and inverter controls expertise into the commercial market with Deltaâs globally-available and fully-supported Power Conditioning System. This will help commercial customers integrate renewable energy resources, manage and reduce their electricity consumption, and provide grid loss resiliency.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Adara is now engaging with its worldwide Partners and Certified Installers to provide a fully integrated Power Conditioning System, Control System, and Energy Storage System to support multiple commercial use cases, such as demand charge reduction, demand response, peak-shifting and emergency back-up power leading to a cleaner, more resilient grid. Pre-sale assistance includes electrical bill analysis, system design support, and installation assistance for initial orders and delivery in Q1 2017. For California customers, the system fully-qualifies for a substantial rebate under the revised Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), with the earliest orders having the best chance of qualifying.</p>
