<p class="responsiveNews">The average weight improvement of an individual using the incentaHEALTH platform is 8 percent over the first year in the program. Sixty-five percent of participants achieve a clinically significant weight loss, dramatically reducing their risks of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and the need for certain medications. In a comparative study conducted by G8Way Health Payments, the companyâs Benefit + Incentive Card Accounts demonstrated increased engagement and program compliance by three times over competing incentive products and rewards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe selected G8Way Health Payments for the companyâs ability to provide highly customized card-based incentive solutions,â said Todd McGuire, Chief Technology Officer of incentaHEALTH. âWith real-time access to spend data, we are able to evaluate how participants are spending reward dollars in their local communities and if buying decisions reflect overall health improvement.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThrough retail spend data, we are beginning to understand key correlations between where consumers are spending their health reward dollars, and the overall success they are realizing within their wellness programs,â said Mark Hall, CEO of G8Way Payments. âWhen you combine incentaHEALTHâs ability to accurately predict health improvement results and our 90 percent customer satisfaction rate, you get a winning solution.â</p>
