<p><a href="http://www.totumwealth.com">Totum&nbsp;Wealth</a>, a provider of digital client engagement and institutional-quality analytics for financial advisors, today announced the opening of a new office in Los Angeles, Calif. to support the company&rsquo;s continued growth in wealth management technology services.</p>
<p>Totum&rsquo;s&nbsp;new office will enable the company to meet the wealth management industry&rsquo;s growing demand for innovative technology that helps financial advisors make informed investment decisions with their clients. Designed to provide advisors with a holistic risk profiling platform,&nbsp;Totumanalyzes each client&rsquo;s unique human capital factors,&nbsp;including:&nbsp;health, family, career, financial concentration and many others. By examining these factors, financial advisors can effectively illustrate and communicate those distinct risk exposures to the client, and create a customized investment portfolio that addresses them. With&nbsp;Totum, advisors can involve their clients throughout the investment process and empower them to make informed decisions thanks to the platform&rsquo;s engaging visualization of portfolio performance and risk.</p>
<p>Launched in January 2016,&nbsp;Totum&nbsp;was developed by seasoned industry veterans, Min Zhang, CFA, previously of PIMCO, and Mark Cone, a former founding partner of Causeway. They observed that the prevailing risk profiling practice was insufficient to expose the full risk picture that would drive truly suitable and customized investment advice. The company&rsquo;s platform has already gained traction with several hundred independent advisors and interest from&nbsp;broker dealers&nbsp;and other technology platforms.</p>
<p>Totum&nbsp;most recently announced a strategic&nbsp;partnership&nbsp;with Envestnet | Yodlee, which allows clients to aggregate financial accounts into&nbsp;Totumvia the Envestnet | Yodlee Aggregation API. Additional integration and new features are slated for this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the wealth management space is facing the transfer of wealth to Millennials, a changing regulatory landscape, and growing adoption of automated investment technology, our platform will help the industry&nbsp;adapt.&rdquo; said Min Zhang,&nbsp;co-founder&nbsp;and CEO of&nbsp;Totum. &ldquo;With our new office, we can dedicate additional resources and efforts to solve the wealth management problems of today.&rdquo;</p>
