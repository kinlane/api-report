<p><a href="http://www.parascript.com/">Parascript</a>, a pioneer in intelligent data extraction, today announced the availability of Parascript OnDemand through a technology partnership with MachineShop, a provider of API-based services for integrating a wide range of enterprise data, applications and workflows. This partnership combines Parascript&rsquo;s transactional data extraction processing with the MachineShop software and cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new offering allows organizations to meet their mobile, SaaS and enterprise needs to locate and extract key data from invoices, checks and receipts. The ease-of-use and simplicity of Parascript OnDemand will further drive the adoption of highly accurate, automated invoice, check and receipt processing by small and mid-size businesses across industries.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;A continuing trend with most technology is to make it simpler to adopt. The migration of legacy APIs to Web-based services is the way to do that. Parascript was looking for a best-of-breed partner to help us establish Parascript OnDemand. MachineShop is a pioneer in cloud-based integration and APIs so they are the perfect match. This allows us to focus on superior classification and data extraction,&rdquo; said Greg Council, the Vice President of Marketing and Product Management at Parascript. &ldquo;The partnership has huge potential to extend our reach in the marketplace and enable every organization to speed the processing of payments and other transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Parascript OnDemand solution provides a highly-scalable API-as-a-Service for systems integrators, mobile app developers and SaaS application providers to easily add high-quality transactional data location and extraction capabilities to business workflows. By partnering with MachineShop, Parascript OnDemand leverages MachineShop&rsquo;s highly-scalable Web API integration platform that serves as the transaction-based backbone to the Parascript solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Each transaction is closely monitored and shepherded through the process in order to support the most stringent service level requirements without the typical high operational costs. By adding a few lines of code, any business can enable its application to submit invoices, checks and receipts to the API and receive key business data back in real-time without having to manage complex data extraction logic or performance scaling.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Customers only need about four lines of code to begin using the service that automatically processes their invoices, receipts and checks,&rdquo; said Mr. Council. &ldquo;We make it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are very excited to partner with a market-leader like Parascript,&rdquo; said MachineShop CEO Michael Campbell. &ldquo;Parascript OnDemand is a logical evolution of their capabilities and a powerful way to deliver sophisticated enterprise Software-as-a-Service.&rdquo;</p>
