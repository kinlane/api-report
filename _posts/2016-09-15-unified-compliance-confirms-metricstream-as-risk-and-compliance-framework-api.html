This allows MetricStreamâs IT GRC application to directly interface with the CCHâs content (Authority Documents, Citations, and Common Controls) enabling their customers to access Authority Document updates in real time as they become available.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âTodayâs modern, global, and highly networked organization requires real time intelligence and information to support its IT compliance and Risk Management initiatives,â Vasant Balasubramanian, Senior Vice President of Product Management at MetricStream said. âThe significant feature of this integration is that users will have direct access to the UCF Common Controls Hubâ¢ for Authority Documents, Citations, Common Controls, Audit Questions, and more. The international regulations, standards, guidelines, and best practices of specific interest to customersâ organizations can now be automatically shared with the MetricStream GRC Libraries which can then be leveraged for compliance self-assessments and audits."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Craig Isaacs, CEO of Unified Compliance, said, âWe are proud to partner with MetricStream as Unified Complianceâs first developer to integrate our content within its IT GRC solution via the CCH API. Previously, MetricStream loaded the UCF data into their application four times a year. Now UCF data will be brought directly into MetricStreamâs app, definitely streamlining the whole Authority Document update process, and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their customerâs overall Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance programs.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Common Controls Hubâ¢, the SaaS portal to the Unified Compliance FrameworkÂ® (UCFÂ®), gives rapid access to a massive library of more than 200,000 individual mandates from 800+ international laws and standards. The Common Controls Hub API is the first API ever to allow access to a patented Governance, Risk, and Compliance framework. The API allows GRC vendors to access and write to the UCF Common Controls framework in order to build complex and robust products without the worry or hassle of having to map their own content. It also allows customers to have a single API license that lets them connect their selected Common Controls to Unified Compliance developersâ GRC apps without having to pay for UCF content licenses for each GRC tool or auditing partner.</p>
