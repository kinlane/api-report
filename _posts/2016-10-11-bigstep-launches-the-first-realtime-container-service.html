<p><a href="http://bigstep.com">Bigstep</a>, the big-data cloud provider, today launched Bigstep Real-Time Container Service designed especially for real-time streaming applications, microservice-based architectures and memory-intensive workloads that require low latency and high performance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The industry is moving toward a fine-grained, streaming compute model to increase resiliency, throughput and reaction time. The&nbsp;challenge now is firstly how to manage all these moving parts and&nbsp;secondly how&nbsp;to avoid cascading latency issues. The Bigstep Real-Time Container Service is designed to address both problems,&rdquo; said&nbsp;Bigstep Founder and CEO Lucas Roh.</p>
<p>The Bigstep Real-Time Container Service is based on Docker and can easily run distributed streaming applications on Bigstep&rsquo;s bare-metal cloud, such as those built on Spark Streaming, Storm/Heron or Flink. Applications can operate at the same performance levels as running directly on bare metal, bypassing performance and security issues associated with hypervisors and virtual machines.</p>
<p>Unique, powerful features include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Low-latency&nbsp;network: 40Gbps container-to-container network fabric, without using overlay networks and without virtual&nbsp;switching;</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">High-performance&nbsp;persistency support:&nbsp;storage volumes follow containers as they move across the cluster;</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Single-tenant bare-metal compute fabric: high-performance bare-metal hosts are single-tenant and hypervisor-free, and&nbsp;yet can be scaled on-demand; and</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">The capacity to quickly design and manage complex streaming architectures using the intuitive drag-and-drop interface or through the Bigstep API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Bigstep Real-Time Container Service provides dynamic resource allocation and load balancing, all within a high-availability and fault-tolerant environment. The benefits include push-button scalability of high-performance environments for real-time analytics. It easily plugs into existing environments, making it simple to &ldquo;containerize&rdquo; monolithic applications into microservice-based solutions. Bigstep Real-Time Containers are available with Bigstep&rsquo;s 24/7 support, without any additional fees to customers.</p>
