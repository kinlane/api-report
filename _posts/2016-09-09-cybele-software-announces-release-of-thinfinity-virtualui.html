This product makes it easy, fast, and inexpensive to take an application developed for the Windows desktop environment and make it available from the web. By using Thinfinity VirtualUI, it can be as simple as adding one line to the existing source code to have a virtualized GUI available through any HTML5 client running on any operating system and any device.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The traditional desktop-to-web transitioning process requires a large investment of time and money, and the need to perform a great amount of recoding. This has forced many companies and developers to put this costly transition on hold. However, this also means they are missing out on untold numbers of potential usersâusers who have moved away from Windows desktops to IPadÂ®s and other such devices.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Many developers may want to keep their desktop platform while also moving to the Web. Having two platforms, Windows/HTML5 does not have to equal twice the work. With Thinfinity VirtualUI, there is no need to maintain multiple source code versions. The additional Thinfinity VirtualUI code will not affect the running of the app in the Windowâs environment.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With a little extra development work, it is also fairly easy for developers to enhance their existing applications with new Web-based features, integrating multimedia resources and online data such as weather forecasts, updated stock market news, etc., adding value and making their current application a more media-rich experience for users on the Web. Thinfinity VirtualUI makes it possible to better serve their current customers, increase the user base and generate new revenue.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>New in Thinfinity VirtualUI 2.0: </strong></p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Enhanced end-user access schema, allowing anonymous or authenticated access selecting from one or more of these methods: Windows Logon, OAuth/2, RADIUS and/or a Custom Authentication method using the Thinfinity Authentication API.</li>
<li>File System and Registry Virtualization helps developers create a secure, controlled and isolated environment for each end-user, mapping and/or exposing only relevant application folders and registry entries.</li>
<li>Session recording/playback to save application sessions and replay them later. There are many scenarios for session recording: reproduction of issues, application demos and tutorials, technical support, audit monitoring, e-learning, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">With the addition of these features, Thinfinity VirtualUI 2.0 achieves a virtualization and integration level that is unique in its kind.</p>
