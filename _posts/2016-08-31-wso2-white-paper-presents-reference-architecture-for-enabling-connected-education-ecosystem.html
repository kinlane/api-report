To support their efforts, WSO2 has published a white paper on implementing an architecture for educational institutions that facilitates access and ensures security while fostering collaboration and creativity.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Connecting the Education Industry</strong><br />The white paper, âConnected Education Reference Architecture,â was written by WSO2 Senior Technical Lead Eranga Perera. He begins by discussing the need for implementing a connected education ecosystem that supports high user turnover, frequent provisioning, diverse roles, and the growing use of online mobile and web apps.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Next, Eranga reviews the key challenges faced in building a connected education ecosystem, including the need to:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Address high edge costs for classroom items, such as digital white boards.</li>
<li>More effectively digitize content, exams, quizzes, lessons and plans.</li>
<li>Increase access to fast broadband connections.</li>
<li>Implement a digital education strategy focused on innovation, not money.</li>
<li>Improve access to information that supports global sharing and collaboration.</li>
<li>Incrementally implement aspects of a digital transformation to gain acceptance of the migration from conventional educational methods.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Eranga also explores key architectural requirements, such as providing access to resources and enabling them to be managed in a collaborative manner across disparate systems, devices and stakeholders. Additionally, he looks at the components of a connected education reference architecture, including a data bus, messaging, security gateway, API gateway, device management, and analytics, among others.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Eranga concludes with two customer use cases from institutions of higher education that demonstrate how WSO2âs 100% open source middleware was used to create end-to-end connected education solutions.</p>
