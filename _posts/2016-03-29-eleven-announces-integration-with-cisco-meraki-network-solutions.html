<p><a href="http://www.elevenwireless.com">Eleven</a>, the leading provider of cloud-based guest Internet management software, officially unveiled their integration with Cisco Meraki cloud networking today.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The joint Eleven-Meraki solution democratizes network functionality that used to be accessible only by enterprise-level infrastructure with complex architectures. ElevenOS complements the Meraki cloud networking feature set with value-added services that engage guests and deliver a consistently high-performance Internet experience. Eleven&rsquo;s enhanced portal can be customized to ensure brand consistency and engage guests by promoting onsite or local services to drive incremental revenue and future bookings.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Central authentication gives businesses the ability to identify people and allow them onto their network via a remote captive portal and a central user database. Once connected, the Eleven platform facilitates creating tiered Internet packages, multiple billing options, personalized services, and more. The Meraki integration opens up the power of the ElevenOS platform to more businesses looking for ways to manage and monetize the guest Internet experience.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Tiered Internet service plans can be created via ElevenOS to support specific guest needs, from web and email browsing to streaming movies and videoconferencing. Since Meraki does not require costly gateway or controller hardware on-site, the integrated solution is more streamlined, making it simpler for service provider partners to deliver this sophisticated platform to hospitality and other verticals.</p>

With its flexible architecture, hotel network integrations and partnerships with leading certified network service providers, the ElevenOS platform enables businesses of all shapes and sizes to easily manage and optimize the guest Internet experience.</p>
