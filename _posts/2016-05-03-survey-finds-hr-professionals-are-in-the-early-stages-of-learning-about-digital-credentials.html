<p><a href="https://www.truecred.com">Accreditrust</a>, the developers of TrueCred&trade;, the first secure digital credential processing platform, released the results of a survey exploring human resources professionals&rsquo; attitudes towards digital credentials, such as digital badges and transcripts.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;There has been a lot of activity with digital credentialing in education,&rdquo; said Accreditrust CEO, Eric Korb.  &ldquo;What we saw in our survey is that, while there has been a lot of positive movement in terms of developing standards and new technologies for the use, viewing, and verification of credentials, HR professionals are still forming opinions about their trustworthiness and value,&rdquo; continued Korb.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We found that some HR professionals are already leveraging credentials, but there is somewhat limited awareness and use,&rdquo; said Korb.  Among the findings, about a quarter of respondents reported using digital credentials, such as digital badges and transcripts, in making hiring decisions.  Despite current usage among HR professionals, a larger number of respondents, 58%, believe that digital credentials will either supplement or replace traditional credentials, like college degrees.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We see a three-pronged problem in the marketplace.  Companies and organizations are having a harder time identifying candidates who possess particular skills; educational institutions are in the middle of a shift in the way they are preparing graduates for 21st Century job demands; and job candidates are struggling to make themselves marketable in a rapidly evolving job market,&rdquo; said Korb.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;These three broad issues are really driving the development of technology to help tackle these challenges, but we&rsquo;re still in the early stages,&rdquo; continued Korb.  &ldquo;For digital credentials to deliver on their promise, we need to lay a solid foundation now.  Credential viewers and verifiers need to be able to trust the information that they obtain from digital credentials.  Making digital credentials secure, standards-based and interoperable are core to this effort.&rdquo;</p>
