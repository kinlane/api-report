<p><a href="http://www.securly.com/">Securly Inc. </a>&ndash; the world&rsquo;s largest cloud-based provider of Internet Security for K-12 schools &ndash; has announced the launch of PageScan, a proprietary approach to building a &ldquo;Blacklist that Learns&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To maintain blacklists, web filtering products often operate in two different ways and incur the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain a static list of websites that are updated periodically &ndash; this leaves the user vulnerable to new websites that may not be a part of a school&rsquo;s blacklist.</li>
<li>HTTP response parsing to infer unknown bad content &ndash; this approach has severe performance limitations.</li>
<li>PageScan is a dynamic solution that remedies weaknesses of previous approaches. PageScan is able to accurately block new content and meet the strict performance constraints of modern K-12 networks. Securly accomplishes this using the following approach:</li>
<li>The first time Securly comes across an unfamiliar site, they let it through.</li>
<li>They then fetch it offline and scan the response content for keywords indicative of inappropriate content.</li>
<li>The first pass is designed to produce False Positives. A second pass is then employed, done with an API call to third-party service Securly has identified as &ldquo;best&ndash;of&ndash;breed.&rdquo;</li>
<li>If the site is identified to be inappropriate for kids, Securly adds it to their blacklist.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">With this approach, Securly can recognize an inappropriate site accessed from a school in the UK and use that intelligence to benefit a school in Texas. This new solution is able to identify &ndash; with high accuracy &ndash; sites belonging to the following categories: porn, drugs, gambling and network misuse. Securly reports that beta tests have shown an extremely low False Positive rate.</p>
