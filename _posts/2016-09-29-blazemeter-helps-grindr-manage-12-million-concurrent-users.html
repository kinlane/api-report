<p><a href="https://blazemeter.com/">BlazeMeter</a>, the leader in open source-based continuous performance testing, today announced that Grindr, the largest all-male mobile social network in the world, accelerated its pace of innovation by 400 percent with BlazeMeter&rsquo;s performance testing platform.</p>
<p>Grindr&rsquo;s mobile app has over 2 million daily active users in 196 countries. In order to develop an infrastructure to handle a high volume of usage, Grindr relies on a wide variety of systems managed by individual engineering teams responsible for Android, iOS, platform and chat, among others. Each team constantly works on new innovations called &ldquo;stories,&rdquo; designed to improve the application&rsquo;s performance and introduce new features.</p>
<p>Grindr&rsquo;s disparate environment relies on a variety of protocols, including XMPP and HTTP. By working with BlazeMeter and leveraging the XMPP JMeter plugin that BlazeMeter contributed to open source, Grindr&rsquo;s engineering team can utilize JMeter&rsquo;s capabilities to run a variety of load and regression tests, at any time, from anywhere. BlazeMeter&rsquo;s platform allows Grindr to run tests at high scale to simulate usage patterns, or at various stages in the development process to validate new improvements.</p>
<p>By using BlazeMeter&rsquo;s ability to test at various points in the development lifecycle, Grindr&rsquo;s development team can quickly verify and demonstrate the ROI of a development project, helping to streamline and accelerate its modern DevOps process. As a result, in 6 months, Grindr went from 2-3 new innovations per month, to between 12-15.</p>
<p>Grindr&rsquo;s performance testing approach also ensures that deficiencies are identified and anticipated load problems are resolved before they ever happen to end-users, ensuring that downtime is far less frequent and mitigated quickly by shifting infrastructure resources. BlazeMeter has also helped validate new infrastructure investments, helping Grindr&rsquo;s team test various usage scenarios across a variety of environments. BlazeMeter recently helped Grindr replace its infrastructure with a new and more efficient platform, helping it save tens of thousands of dollars in hosting costs.</p>
<p>With the help of BlazeMeter&rsquo;s testing capabilities, Grindr can handle 1.2 million concurrent users during peak traffic times, and continuously release new upgrades and features to engage its fast-growing community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BlazeMeter makes development easier by helping us deliver important features while reducing any kind of impact they have on our performance,&rdquo; said Marco Huerta, QA Manager, Grindr. &ldquo;It has the flexibility to run a selection of tests on a variety of protocols from one tool, helping our team develop a resilient, self-healing system that recovers faster and gives our users the features they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Modern development teams understand that testing isn&rsquo;t just about preparing for outages, it&rsquo;s a valuable way to increase a company&rsquo;s rate of innovation,&rdquo; said Alon Grimonsky, CEO of BlazeMeter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an indication of the versatility and value of testing throughout the development lifecycle. When an application with 2 million daily users considers uptime a secondary benefit of load testing, it speaks to the holistic value it brings to the DevOps process.&rdquo;</p>
