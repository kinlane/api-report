<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_60340_erqtextlogo.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.aspg.com">Advanced Software Products Group, Inc. (ASPG)</a> has released version 2.4.2 of their ERQ (Easy RACF Query) software. ERQ simplifies the task of administering IBMâs RACF access-security system through the provision of a fully customizable API, the automation of common RACF functions, the capability for RACF analysts to create their own custom applications via a set of straightforward ISPF services, and other functionality that allows ERQ users to better administer their RACF installation with little to no learning curve.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With the release of v2.4.2, ERQ presents improved usability as well as increased product functionality options. One such option is ERQâs support of additional password characters outlined in APAR OA43999. This feature allows ERQ users to utilize the most up-to-date password characters. The load library options available to ERQ users have increased as well, allowing ERQ users to select from COBOL version 4.2 and version 5.1.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Improved usability is demonstrated in the latest releaseâs ability to support point-and-shoot capabilities for all panels as well as support for the use of wildcards in the HLQ field of the EXTRACT File Selection panel. Through the point-and-shoot capability, ERQ users can more efficiently and easily navigate their way around the ERQ menus. The use of wildcards in the HLQ field of the EXTRACT File Selection panel and the use of Library Management (LM) routines allow for improved search time in building the list of files and greater flexibility when defining filtering used to create the list of files. ERQ v2.4.2 also retains a history of RACF settings in the ICB file, and will allow for reports on ICB files in a future release.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The release of ERQ v2.4.2 brings multiple security enhancements as well. Security enhancements include interfacing with health checker systems and allowing control over when auto SETR REFRESH is active. Rather than needing to develop or implement an additional security system, ERQ allows end users to utilize their existing homegrown health checker systems as well as IBMâs Health Checker for z/OS. ERQ directly interfaces to these systems, greatly increasing system security and functionality by assisting system operators with the discovery and diagnosing of RACF issues.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Also contributing to system security is the capability of allowing users with SPECIAL authority to control when auto SETR REFRESH is active. In addition to automatically generating the necessary SETROPTS REFRESH commands for RACF required in-storage profiles, ERQ now allows for the REFRESH capability to be disabled if the qualified end user prefers. This customized experience allows for increased control as well as greater security.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additional recent enhancements to ERQ include faster processing, more reporting options, simplified data management, and automatic generation of SETROPTS REFRESH commands. RACF requires certain PROFILES be refreshed from the database into storage when changed, but ERQ now automatically generates the necessary SETROPTS REFRESH commands for RACF required in-storage profiles, eliminating additional steps for RACF administrators. ERQ also incorporates the new IBM special character set now permitted in passwords, as well as changes for mixed case passwords.</p>
