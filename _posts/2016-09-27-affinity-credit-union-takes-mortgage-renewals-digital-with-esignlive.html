<p><a href="http://www.esignlive.com">eSignLive&trade;</a>, the e-signature choice for business, today announced Affinity Credit Union has launched e-signatures for mortgage renewals and plans to build e-signatures as a shared service across the organization. Affinity services 135,000 members with 66 branches in 57 Saskatchewan communities.</p>
<p>Affinity needed a way to conveniently enable its geographically dispersed membership to sign documents remotely, including mortgage renewals. Mortgage renewals were an ideal candidate for Affinity to trial with existing members as there was value in speeding up the process for both parties.</p>
<p>Before implementing eSignLive, the manual process could take up to a week once the initial discussion was completed by phone, as documents were mailed out, signed, and either mailed or faxed back to be scanned and uploaded back into the system.</p>
<p>Now with e-signatures, transactions can be completed at any time, from anywhere, in just minutes. Both members and staff see an improvement in speed, service, and convenience as a result, plus the credit union lowers its risk around delayed renewals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Integrating eSignLive into our mortgage renewal system and ECM platform was easy using the open API and documentation, and as a result we have a tightly integrated process that helps us improve our efficiency and the service to our members,&rdquo; said Affinity Credit Union EVP and Chief Information Officer Atul Varde.</p>
<p>After implementing e-signatures for the mortgage renewal application, Affinity now plans to build e-signatures as a shared service using eSignLive&rsquo;s open API for any process within the organization. Future use-cases like HR onboarding or account openings could conceivably be up and running in just a few weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affinity values the fact that eSignLive is a Canadian company with local data centres, meaning member data is protected by Canadian laws, plus there are no data latency issues so transactions aren&rsquo;t slow or delayed, which would negatively affect the customer experience,&rdquo; said eSignLive President Tommy Petrogiannis.</p>
