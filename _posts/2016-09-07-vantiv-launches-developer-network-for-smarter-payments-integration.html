                            </p><p class = "responsiveNews"> <a href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudmFudGl2LmNvbS8=" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow">Vantiv, Inc.</a> (NYSE: VNTV), a leading provider of payment processing services and related technology solutions for merchants and financial institutions of all sizes, launched Vantiv O.N.E., One Network Experience, today to provide software developers a best-in-class destination for integrating payments into their applications for mobile, in-store and online processing. Vantiv O.N.E. is combining Vantivâs leadership in integrated payments and industry leading scale of its processing platform, to enable software developers to get their applications to market faster, make compliance and security easier, and help fuel innovation in the increasingly complex market for omni-channel commerce solutions. Vantiv O.N.E., designed around an open ecosystem payments philosophy, provides a <a href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g/dj1mVG4tZnN2bFVhZyZmZWF0dXJlPXlvdXR1LmJl" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow">single destination</a> for key integration tools, personalized payments expertise and a unique community of developers.</p>
<p class = "responsiveNews">âThe rapid pace of change in payments has resulted in increasing complexities for developers, inhibiting speed to market and innovation,â said Jordan McKee, senior analyst of payments at 451 Research. âVantiv O.N.E. is well positioned to help developers address their evolving commerce needs by streamlining payment integration through centralized and scalable omni-channel payment processing resources.â</p>
<p class = "responsiveNews">The new developer network provides three key, value-added features:
<br /></p><ul class="releaseul"><li>  TechTools â A comprehensive suite of integration tools, all in one place so that developers donât have to hunt for these critical resources. These tools include Vantivâs APIs and SDKs (with documentation), sample code, dev sandboxes, and test environments, which allow developers to integrate across payment types, including brick-and-mortar, card-not-present, mobile, etc.</li>
 <li> TechLift â The one place for personalized payments expertise, guidance and hands-on help, including access to work with a dedicated payments integration expert. As part of TechLift, Vantiv also operates a special Innovation Lab where developers can physically visit and get the help they need to build payments functionality right on site.</li>
 <li> TechTribe â A developer community that provides a single place to learn, get inspired, and connect with fellow developers by sharing experiences and solutions. Because of the complexity of payments integration, developers need more than just tools and documentation, and TechTribe helps provide that kinship.</li></ul><p class = "responsiveNews"></p>
<p class = "responsiveNews">âVantiv helps minimize the complexity of payment integration,â said Viren Balar, co-founder and chief technology officer at Ziosk, the maker of the world's first ordering, entertainment and pay-at-the table tablet serving more than 50 million guests each month in casual dining restaurants. âAt a single destination, Vantiv O.N.E., our developers can access the resources to integrate existing and emerging payment methods, support for our Ziosk device, and support for any channel in all the popular coding languages. Itâs truly a comprehensive solution powered by an open ecosystem approach that is unique to Vantiv.â</p>
<p class = "responsiveNews">Membership in Vantiv O.N.E. is free and open to developers across the payments spectrum, including, enterprise businesses, eCommerce, integrated payments, mobile, point-of-sale, and payment facilitators. </p>
<p class = "responsiveNews">âThe demand for sophisticated and seamless, integrated payments applications for online, in-store and mobile solutions is increasing at a substantial rateâ said Matt Taylor, group president integrated payments and emerging channels at Vantiv. âVantiv O.N.E. provides a payment integration experience to software developers that can help them solve even the most complex challenges the market is facing.â </p>
<p class = "responsiveNews">âVantiv O.N.E. isnât hardware restrictive, and it doesnât force you into specific payment types. It simply gives you the option to choose an integration toolkit to create solutions that work for you,â said Chris Whatley, chief information officer at DipJar, an electronic tip jar company that is used by thousands of restaurants and non-profits around the United States. âGiven the complex and rapidly evolving payments technology, Vantiv O.N.E helps you stay ahead.â</p>
