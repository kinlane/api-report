<p>Unified Computer Intelligence Corporation (UCIC) has launched a new contest to encourage developers to use two of its tools for prototyping voice interaction - the Ubi Portal "Skill" for making it faster and easier for developers to connect their APIs to the Amazon Alexa platform for testing and the Lexa App - an Android-based app for testing interaction with Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa Voice Service. The contest encourages developers to complete up to seven challenges and to post videos of their work for judging. The entries wil be judged on creativity, demonstrated skill, and utility. The contest will run from September 29, 2016, until 11:59 PM EDT on November 4, 2016. Winners will be announced November 12, 2016.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The contest includes the following challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launching and landing a drone&nbsp;</li>
<li>Dispensing a treat or candy from an Internet-connected device&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sending out SMS and emails&nbsp;</li>
<li>Calling an API and pushing the response to Alexa&nbsp;</li>
<li>Initiating conference calls&nbsp;</li>
<li>Completing three tasks simultaneously&nbsp;</li>
<li>Chaining together actuation of 10 or more actions</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">The voice command to control these developer challenges should come from UCIC&rsquo;s Lexa App, which is a tool to test voice interactions with Alexa Skills. &ldquo;This contest and prizes are a great way to get people to start testing the idea of adding voice interaction to different devices,&rdquo; says Leor Grebler, CEO of UCIC, &ldquo;we think it will encourage developers who want to consider adding a voice element to their programs and designs.&rdquo; The contest offers over $1,000 (USD) in Amazon gift cards, including a grand prize of $600.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About the Ubi Portal Voice Prototyping Skill</strong><br />Using the Ubi Portal (portal.theubi.com), developers can create a lesson using graphical rules that will teach an Alexa app new things: sending email and text messages; controlling devices like Nest, Harmony, SmartThings, and others; creating customized responses through the Amazon Echo; and, making calls to web APIs, parsing their requests, and announcing the response back through an Amazon Echo or Alexa Voice Service connected device. Once developers have setup a free account, they can connect to any Alexa enabled device by adding the skill at alexa.amazon.com.</p>
