The Affordable Housing feature sets are an extension of the already robust core conventional offering.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ResMan Affordable Housing Property Management Software offers users the ability to support single program/subsidy and layered program/subsidy properties with HUD, Tax Credits (including HOME and Bond) and more. In keeping with the core ResMan solution, the affordable housing features deliver needed functionality with an intuitive user interface. The increase in functionality by ResMan Affordable eliminates manual processes and improves the ease of use for operators that current software offerings cannot provide. ResMan Affordable Housing Software is all-encompassing as opposed to an a-la-carte approach which often inflates the cost for the consumer.</p>
