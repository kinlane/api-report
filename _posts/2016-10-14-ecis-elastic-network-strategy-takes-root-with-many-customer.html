<p>"The industry's reception of the ELASTIC Network strategy has been enthusiastic. We have gained considerable traction in the market, mainly because our solutions are properly addressing key industry pain points. The net result: over 30 new wins and many new bids coming from first time customers," said ECI CEO <span class="xn-person"><span>Darryl Edwards</span></span>. "In addition, the success of the ELASTIC Network strategy has catapulted ECI into the limelight as a true visionary and industry thought leader. For example, ECI was recently invited to lead MEF's OpenLSO Service Fulfillment Program and a multi-carrier&nbsp;PoC at MEF16. ECI has also cooperated on joint projects with NIA (the NEW IP agency) and the ONF (OpenFlow Foundation) to further our goal of driving open, vendor agnostic solution."</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the ELASTIC Network in <span class="xn-chron">June 2015</span>, ECI has launched many new, innovative solutions all of which have been cited for multiple industry accolades (Light Reading, Heavy Reading, LTE Awards, and Global Telecom Awards). On the list, the 9900 family of high capacity ODU switching product line, the NPT1800 high capacity Carrier Ethernet system, NFV solutions and virtual functions, LightAPPS&trade; SDN applications and LightSEC&trade; cyber security solutions.</p>
<p>Telecommunications services and networks are changing more quickly than ever before, making the task of selecting and investing in networks much more complex. In today's ultra-competitive world, challenges include making the right investments to support thriving business for years to come. Networks are 'cloudified' and functions are virtualized, things unheard of only a few years ago. Today the ability of a network to address those trends is key to success. ECI continues to develop open, vendor agnostic and secure solutions, always with an eye on enabling a smooth migration to future technologies.</p>
<p>Central to ECI's ELASTIC Networks is the company's SmartLIGHT&trade; portfolio framework which leverages the company's vast networking experience. &nbsp;It is comprised of four interconnected functional blocks: an advanced transport layer, a control layer, an SDN/NFV applications layer and a comprehensive cyber security layer encapsulating the other three. To further its goal of providing truly open, future proof solutions, ECI continues to implement and offer open APIs for full functionality in multi-vendor environments, NFV capabilities and remote software upgrades. ECI's advanced packet-optical product lines continue to combine supreme performance with OPEX saving efficiencies, which ensure they will service customers for many years ahead. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Edwards concluded, "With commitment and focus, ECI is and plans to remain on the path to delivering truly open, ELASTIC networks and to doing its part to helping the industry to smoothly transition and remain competitive in the future."</p>
<p>ECI will be showcasing the provisioning of dynamic CE 2.0 services across multiple carriers at the upcoming MEF16 in <span class="xn-location"><span><span>Baltimore, MD</span></span></span> in November. Stop by the ECI booth to hear more.</p>
