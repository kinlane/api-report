<p><a href="http://www.art19.com/">#mce_temp_url#</a>Podcast technology company ART19 officially launches today, announcing that Midroll Media, DGital Media and Wondery are leveraging the platform&rsquo;s advanced capabilities for dynamic ad insertion, audience targeting and listener measurement. Founded by software entrepreneur Sean Carr and podcast producer Matt Belknap, ART19 is emerging from beta following eight months of extensive testing with more than 350 shows.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">New data from Wondery and comScore shows that people prefer ads in podcasts over any other digital medium. ART19&rsquo;s targeting and measurement capabilities are helping brands leverage this engagement.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to Hernan Lopez, former Fox International Channels CEO and now Founder and CEO of Wondery, &ldquo;Podcast advertising commands high CPMs because it works, but brands and agencies want more control and better measurement. ART19 provides the analytics they&rsquo;re looking for. ART19&rsquo;s targeting and dynamic ad insertion also opens up new revenue opportunities for us and our clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ART19&rsquo;s benefits include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Dynamic Insertion of Host-Read Spots: ART19&rsquo;s proprietary WarpFeed&reg; technology enables publishers to update back catalogs with fresh advertising; back catalogs comprise more than 50 percent of listening on some podcasts.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&nbsp;</p>
<li>Ad Targeting: ART19 enables delivery of different ads to different listeners of a podcast episode, even in iTunes.</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&nbsp;</p>
<li>APIs for Improved Audience Measurement: ART19 players and APIs offer vastly improved listening data relative to what is available in RSS, the distribution format that still dominates the space.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Says ART19 Founder and CEO Sean Carr, &ldquo;With our players and APIs, podcast producers will get listening telemetry. They will see when their listeners start, stop, and skip. They will finally be able to sell impressions, not just downloads.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Adds DGital&rsquo;s Chief Content Officer Chris Corcoran, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been working with ART19 since our launch because we find their player and analytics, along with their top tier team, to be the best in the industry. We look forward their continued product development, which will help drive innovation for the podcasting ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;While podcasting has always offered the type of lean forward engagement that advertisers are looking for, it had limitations,&rdquo; commented Teddy Lynn, a Chief Creative Officer at Ogilvy &amp; Mather and member of ART19's board of directors. &ldquo;With ART19's technology, we now have measurement, targeting and contextual relevance at scale, and as a result, I would expect more agencies and brands to consider adding the medium to their mix."</p>
