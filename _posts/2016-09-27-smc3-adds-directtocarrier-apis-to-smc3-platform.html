<p><a href="http://www.smc3.com/">SMC&sup3;</a> has unveiled the latest web-based APIs added to the SMC&sup3; Platform, an innovative hub of less-than-truckload transportation technology solutions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SMC&sup3;&rsquo;s newest transportation APIs include Execution and Visibility web-service solutions that provide event-based visibility to streamline workflows by sending alerts when shipments require action or attention.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SMC&sup3;&rsquo;s transportation APIs, delivered through the secure SMC&sup3; cloud, offer shippers, 3PLs and other users unrivaled speed and computing power. When direct-to-carrier APIs are combined with industrial-strength, analytical APIs like RateWare XL and CarrierConnect XL, the SMC&sup3; Platform becomes a one-stop shop for transportation technology needs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Leveraging the expertise and trust gained by serving the extended logistics community for decades, the company&rsquo;s SMC&sup3; Platform now provides the only transportation APIs designed to proactively enable shipment visibility and to help create agile supply chains. This latest release of APIs adds status, dispatch and imaging capabilities to the SMC&sup3; Platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Real-time connectivity of APIs is only the first step, and this is where other market solutions stop,&rdquo; said David Knight, SMC&sup3;&rsquo;s CIO and senior vice president of product development. &ldquo;SMC&sup3;&rsquo;s Execution and Visibility web-service APIs provide an unparalleled level of intelligence versus other offerings in the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The SMC&sup3; Platform is a holistic solution that will support both EDI and API communications. In addition, SMC&sup3;&rsquo;s pioneering API message standardization brings order to individual carrier terminology by providing a standard vocabulary across document types, and status and error codes.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are the only provider that solves the entire less-than-truckload business lifecycle, guiding our customers from initial rating and transit analytics to shipment visibility, execution and audit,&rdquo; said SMC&sup3; CEO and President Andrew Slusher. &ldquo;With both high-horsepower, analytical APIs and transactional Execution and Visibility APIs, SMC&sup3; empowers customers with solutions tailored to their specific transportation operating environment.&rdquo;</p>
