Together, Equinox and PayJunction have eliminated the lengthy and painstaking process of EMV Level 3 certification.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Free to qualified customers, the Smart Terminal not only allows businesses to process EMV chip cards, traditional magÂ­stripe cards and contactless payments like Apple PayÍ¾ it also supports advanced features including signature capture and digital receipts. For the first time, third-party software developers can integrate all types of payment in just a few hours, rather than months, using PayJunctionâs API. In addition, developers can leverage PayJunction's existing PCI and EMV certification to limit or possibly negate annual audits altogether.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe have made payments simple for developers again. Our Smart Terminal will limit PCI scope and provide instant EMV certification for developers so they can focus on what they are best at: building amazing software. Let us handle the rest,â said Randy Modos, President, PayJunction. âThe integration specialists at Equinox worked closely with us to develop a unique semi-Â­integrated solution that reduces the complexities associated with PCI & EMV compliance.â</p>
