<p><a href="https://www.wayfair.com/">Wayfair Inc.</a> (NYSE:W), one of the world&rsquo;s largest online destinations for home furnishings and d&eacute;cor, today announced the launch of its first-party 3D Model API. Developed by Wayfair Next, the company&rsquo;s in-house research and development team, the platform enables access to more than 10,000 3D furniture and d&eacute;cor models, allowing developers to integrate more realistic content into their applications. The announcement marks the first API launch for Wayfair since the company was founded in 2002.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Technology innovation is deeply engrained in Wayfair&rsquo;s culture,&rdquo; said Steve Conine, co-founder and co-chairman, Wayfair. &ldquo;Through our team&rsquo;s dedicated efforts to expand our 3D model library to encompass thousands of products, we now have one of the largest 3D selections of any home d&eacute;cor company. We are excited to be first to market with our world-class 3D model API for home furnishings, and look forward to seeing future developments that stretch beyond the home space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leveraging technology developed in house, Wayfair has built an extensive 3D model library to fuel its ongoing innovation in photographic rendering, virtual and augmented reality. WayfairView and Patio Playground, launched in June and August of this year, utilize Wayfair&rsquo;s 3D models to create an elevated shopping experience for their consumers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Wayfair, we never stop innovating as we continue to transform the way people shop for their homes,&rdquo; added Steve Conine. &ldquo;With the launch of our 3D model API, we are enabling people to visualize furnishings and d&eacute;cor in their homes in a way that was never possible before.&nbsp;Whether harnessing the technology to help real estate developers better envision the interior design of a new building, or for a video game integration to add an extra level of authenticity to the player experience, we are excited to explore what&rsquo;s next with our API launch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To gain access to the API, interested developers should contact Wayfair. Once approved, they will be given an individual key to unlock access to the API.</p>
