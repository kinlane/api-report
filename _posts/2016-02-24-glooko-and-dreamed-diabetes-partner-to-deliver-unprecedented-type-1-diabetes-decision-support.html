<p><a href="http://www.glooko.com">Glooko, Inc.</a>, provider of the leading unified platform for diabetes management, and DreaMed Diabetes, developer of innovative and patient-centric decision support technologies for insulin-dependent people with diabetes (PWDs), today announced a partnership to commercialize DreaMed&rsquo;s Advisor algorithm using the Glooko platform. The partners will demonstrate the integrated solution at the Advanced Technologies &amp; Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD) conference, from 3-6 February 2016 in Milan, Italy.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Glooko and DreaMed aim to vastly improve insulin management for over 30 million people with type 1 diabetes globally [1], about 35% of whom currently use insulin pumps [2]. Glooko&rsquo;s diabetes platform enables a PWD to download and visualize data from their diabetes device using their mobile phone and makes this data available to clinicians via the secure cloud. With the integration of DreaMed&rsquo;s MD-Logic Pump Advisor into Glooko&rsquo;s platform, insulin pump data can be assessed for patterns that yield personalized recommendations for critical pump-related settings, including basal rates and insulin-to-carb ratios. These recommendations are made available to clinicians via Glooko&rsquo;s Population Management application, which allows a review of the therapeutic basis behind the recommended adjustment. Once approved, the recommendations are made available via the Glooko app on the PWD&rsquo;s mobile phone.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For Glooko, the collaboration with DreaMed Diabetes is an initial step towards the company&rsquo;s broader initiative to cultivate an &lsquo;app store for diabetes algorithms and tools&rsquo;, all of which leverage Glooko&rsquo;s robust diabetes data engine and mobile app/web capabilities. &ldquo;Clinicians, mathematicians, and data engineers from universities and companies worldwide have been developing algorithms capable of using diabetes data to micro-optimize each component of diabetes management, from insulin pump settings to dietary choices&rdquo; said Rick Altinger, Glooko CEO. He continued, &ldquo;Enabling partners to use Glooko&rsquo;s vast diabetes dataset to deliver personalized insights at the patient-level will give clinicians the information they need to provide impactful recommendations that can improve health outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By allowing diabetes decision support tools to be built on the Glooko platform, the company is carving a path for PWDs and clinicians to get access to innovative technology to help improve their overall decision making. At the same time, Glooko provides a scalable way to enable organizations that create these algorithms to test, improve and ultimately commercialize them, bringing innovation to the forefront of positively impacting the lives of people with diabetes.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">DreaMed CEO, Eran Atlas, said &ldquo;We are very gratified to be collaborating with Glooko on the first commercialization project for our Advisor technology. Together, we will transform critical diabetes data into actionable information, giving healthcare providers a clinically effective, patient-specific decision support tool. Our collaboration is designed to raise the bar for fast, efficient and personalized medicine, by providing both doctors and diabetes patients with a holistic, simple glucose balancing solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The partnership with Glooko is part of DreaMed&rsquo;s overall strategy to transform Advisor into a necessary analytical component in any diabetes management system offering advanced personalized medicine. Future collaborations will include partnering with stakeholders that generate, collect and store patient data, to provide real-time glucose balance and behavioral guidance. Such collaborations can transform collected data into actionable information, with the aim of enabling DreaMed partners to provide more holistic and simple solutions for diabetes patients.</p>
