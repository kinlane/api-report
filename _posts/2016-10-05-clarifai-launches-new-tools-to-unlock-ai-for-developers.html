<p><a href="https://clarifai.com/">Clarifai</a>, the leading visual recognition AI company that uses sophisticated machine learning to understand images and videos, today announced two new products: Custom Training and Visual Search. Available for developers and businesses of all sizes, these products significantly further Clarifai&rsquo;s mission to empower all developers and businesses to easily build visual recognition solutions into every app and business workflow.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Custom Training puts the power to train artificial intelligence into the hands of every developer and business, allowing them to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; Clarifai&rsquo;s visual recognition API to understand everything we see in the world around us in a matter of seconds. Users can train concepts as granular as a specific brand of clothing in an image or video, and they can also create &ldquo;custom models&rdquo; that recognize specific sub-categories to match their distinct needs (e.g. &ldquo;on-brand user-generated content&rdquo;). New concepts can be trained with high accuracy orders of magnitude faster than before, requiring less than ten images per concept as compared to the thousands of images per concept traditional AI training required. Custom Training is particularly powerful for businesses, allowing any business to use AI without the high cost of maintaining hardware, the technical expertise of a data science team, or the large amount of quality data traditionally required to teach AI. In addition to the business value, this increased ability for individuals to teach computers how to &ldquo;see&rdquo; allows for artificial intelligence to have a more comprehensive and diverse worldview.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Visual Search allows any user to easily organize, access, or recommend their images or products by visual similarity and/or keyword, enabling developers and businesses to better connect their users with what they&rsquo;re looking for. For example, if a person sees a photo of a celebrity wearing a pair of shoes, they can search any Clarifai-powered e-commerce website using that photo to find visually-similar products, which would lead to better results than a text search. A user can also combine text with image search, so they can browse and find images by both visual relevance and keyword tags. Visual Search also enables businesses and developers to serve users with more relevant and accurate recommendations based on visual similarity that are instantly updated as they browse, rather than less relevant recommendations based on past behavior or similar users. This advanced technology, previously only available to large tech companies, is now available to any developer or business through the Clarifai API.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our mission at Clarifai is to foster the growth of artificial intelligence and build a powerful platform that allows computers to see the world as humans do,&rdquo; said Clarifai founder and CEO Matthew Zeiler. &ldquo;This capability needs to be as open and accessible as possible so that AI learns from a diverse group of teachers and can be made useful for anyone&rsquo;s specific needs. Our new products propel our mission exponentially and we are excited to see how our customers put them to use.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">These new product launches come on the heels of Clarifai&rsquo;s recent release of three new domain models: the Not Safe For Work adult content moderation model, which recognizes potentially offensive nudity; the Travel model, which can recognize travel-related concepts like &ldquo;hot tub,&rdquo; &ldquo;kids area,&rdquo; and &ldquo;indoor swimming pool;&rdquo; and most recently, the Food model, which can recognize food images down to the ingredient level. These models have been used by companies large and small, including Trivago, 500px. and BuzzFeed. Clarifai&rsquo;s usage-based pricing model enables businesses with any budget to more easily innovate, go to market faster, and build better user experiences with AI.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Clarifai is offering a free Developer Preview of these new products for a limited time. For more info on Clarifai, Custom Training, and Visual Search, visit Clarifai.com</p>
