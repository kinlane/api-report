<p><a href="https://www.continuum.net/">Continuum<sup>&reg;</sup></a>, the only channel-exclusive IT management platform company, has released the Continuum Reporting API, allowing open access to agent asset data by third party vendors and Continuum&rsquo;s MSP partners. With the new Reporting API, vendors can now integrate with Continuum to help increase efficiencies in client workflow and gain insight into combined data. Meeting MSP partners&rsquo; demand, the company&rsquo;s partners can now make authenticated requests for raw reporting data to build custom reports in-house or through a third party reporting vendor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="pull-quote">&ldquo;We are happy to answer the call from our MSP partners to provide access        to Continuum&rsquo;s raw reporting data to allow integration with their third        party vendors in order to build custom reports in-house, streamline        documentation and more,&rdquo; said Brian        Herr, Vice President, Products at Continuum. &ldquo;We expect this new        open API to be used for endless&nbsp;opportunities for partners to        increase&nbsp;their workflow efficiencies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Reporting API provides access to more than 200 unique data fields, ranging from basic machine information to patching, antivirus and backup data. Integration is possible with any third party vendor that can leverage agent asset information. Vendor integration opportunities with this open API are expansive, ranging from reporting tools to documentation systems to lead generation.</p>
<p>Leveraging the new Reporting API, Continuum now integrates with IT Glue&trade;, a proven, best practices-driven IT documentation platform packed with features designed to help MSPs reduce waste and maximize profit. IT Glue now connects with Continuum&rsquo;s Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform, continuously synchronizing servers and workstations into IT Glue, where documentation can be created and maintained effortlessly with the information always up-to-date. MSPs can access useful asset information including memory, disk and CPU, directly into IT Glue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IT Glue was privileged to be involved in the evolution of Continuum&rsquo;s Reporting API, and we are excited to be able to leverage it through integration to provide value to our mutual partners,&rdquo; said Chris Day, CEO at IT Glue. &ldquo;It has been a pleasure working with Continuum on this project and we look forward to the future of this strong partnership.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also leveraging the Reporting API, Continuum now integrates with BrightGauge, providing consolidation of IT vendor reports in one place and allowing MSPs to build in-house custom reports, charts and dashboards to increase technicians&rsquo; efficiency. MSPs now can create custom reports and dashboards that integrate reporting from other tools as well such as QuickBooks, DropBox and all the major PSA tools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Continuum team made a commitment to roll out a newly improved Reporting API with our recommendations included, and they proved to us that they are not only a company that stands behind their commitments, but they are able to move fast and be nimble even given all their priorities,&rdquo; said Eric Dosal, Co-Founder and CEO of BrightGauge. &ldquo;We were in constant communication with the product team, getting regular updates on progress and requests for information. It showed they are serious partner to work with which is very refreshing in the industry.&rdquo;</p>
