The conference, held in Anaheim, CA, October 25-28, brings together leading higher ed IT professionals demonstrating best practices as well as sharing ideas and effective processes with colleagues.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">OneCampus, an Internet2 NET+ service offering, takes a fresh, new approach to organizing web-based campus services. Unlike traditional portals, OneCampus is a cloud-based platform with powerful APIs that allow popular campus programs such as a finance system, LMS, or SIS to push data to OneCampus. OneCampus features a Google-like search, and ratings & reviews to effectively identify what services are most popular. For users, finding and discovering campus services has never been easier; OneCampus makes it simple to search for essential information with a mobile-friendly, highly intuitive, single sign-on platform. Users can now enjoy exciting features in their own OneCampus portal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alerts - Banner alerts provide administrators a quick and easy way to share urgent messages with all institutional usersÂ </li>
<li>Global Announcements - Administrators can communicate campus-wide updates or news feeds to all end users in a timely mannerÂ </li>
<li>Google Analytics Enhancements - More detailed usage data now sent to Google Analytics</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWorking with the Internet2 community through the NET+ program has allowed us to engage institutions in a much more collaborative manner. rSmart constantly gathers feedback from our customers and the NET+ community process really helps to advance discussions on where OneCampus should be going.â said rSmart CEO Tony Potts. âInternet2 has been an invaluable partner, working with us to more easily provide an exceptional product and partner experience that colleges and universities really enjoy. We look forward to showcasing OneCampus in the rSmart booth at EDUCAUSE with our Internet2 colleagues and we welcome attendees to visit our booth to learn more about the NET+ OneCampus solution.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The NET+ OneCampus service is the result of the collaboration between seven universities, Internet2, and rSmart to provide a unique offering to the higher education community. The Internet2 NET+ service validation was completed by BYU-Idaho, Clemson University, Indiana University, University of Maryland, University of Nebraska at Omaha, University of Pittsburgh, and University of Utah, who worked together to guide and shape this Internet2 NET+ validated solution. OneCampus has now been implemented in over 30 higher ed institutions across the country.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âIt has been a pleasure to continue our work with the community focused team at rSmart. Through the efforts of rSmart and universities on the NET+ OneCampus Advisory Board, we have seen growing interest and adoption of this service and engagement across the Internet2 membership.â said Shel Waggener, Senior Vice President at Internet2. âWe are confident the offering will continue to evolve based on the needs of higher education and rSmartâs willingness to listen and embrace an ever changing community.â</p>
