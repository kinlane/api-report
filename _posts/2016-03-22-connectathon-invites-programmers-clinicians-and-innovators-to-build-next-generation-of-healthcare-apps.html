The event will challenge programmers, clinicians, and innovators of all kinds to utilize the Epic sandbox in order to build new applications utilizing Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Standard (FHIR) application programing interface (API) standards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;FHIR opens up exciting opportunities for developers to build across interoperable EHRs. We&rsquo;re excited to work with Eskenazi Health and Indiana HIMSS to encourage grassroots innovation by the broader developer community.&rdquo; &ndash; Janet Campbell, Vice President of Patient Engagement at Epic</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The connectathon stems from the many challenges healthcare currently faces across the country, including: putting patient data in the hands of patients, identifying at-risk populations, monitoring patients at risk for falls, identifying inappropriate medication use, and care planning across the continuum. The event seeks to turn innovators loose to create unique applications that address these issues and many more.</p>
