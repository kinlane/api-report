<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/managedmethods_logo.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>ManagedMethods, a leading provider in the cloud access security broker (CASB) space, today announced its newest integration with Check Point Software Technologies Ltd (NASDAQ: CHKP). The combined solution integrates ManagedMethodsâ Cloud Access Monitor CASB product with Check Pointâs SandBlast Zero-Day Protection API, allowing IT teams to automatically detect and quarantine malware in both sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud apps.</p>
<p>âWe are very excited about this evolution in our partnership with Check Point,â said Charlie Sander, CEO of ManagedMethods. âNow in addition to audit and control of popular cloud apps, Cloud Access Monitor will have the additional benefit of zero-day malware detection so companies can defend themselves against these malicious attacks. Our combined solution provides a comprehensive defense against cloud-based threats.â</p>
<p>Benefits of the new integration include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><strong>Gain visibility into Shadow IT and sanctioned cloud application usage</strong>Â so you know who is using which cloud apps and what data is being shared in the cloud.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><strong>Detect and block Zero-Day malwareÂ </strong>before your company is exposed to risk.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><strong>Extend threat protection</strong>Â beyond the network perimeter leveraging cloud-native APIs with popular cloud collaboration apps including Office 365/OneDrive, Google Apps, Box, and Dropbox.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"><strong>Identify risk level of all cloud apps in use</strong>, including behavioral analysis of user activity over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>âA large portion of the value in todayâs security products can be measured by how well they integrate into existing investments,â said Adrian Sanabria, Senior Security Analyst at 451 Research. âThe concept of fourth-party interactions exists in the world of SaaS, but is invisible to in-line proxies or firewalls. This is due to the interaction occurring between two third parties (saving a file from Office 365 directly into Box, for example), meaning it doesnât come across âthe wire.â Visibility into this blind spot requires some level of API integration with the SaaS provider. Conversely, CASB vendors generally have no malware detection capabilities, making a malware analysis partnership ideal.â</p>
<p>ManagedMethods and Check Point have formed this partnership to deliver enhanced network security and cloud control. The integration of the two security solutions ensures high-performance network and cloud application protection in our rapidly evolving threat landscape.</p>
<p>âManaged Methods brings value to our partnership by integrating Cloud Access Monitor with Check Pointâs SandBlast Zero Day Protection API,â said Alon Kantor, Vice President of Business Development at Check Point Software. âOur integration with ManagedMethods allows our customers to gain visibility of unsanctioned and high-risk cloud applications while also elevating network security to the next level with evasion-resistant malware detection. SandBlast Zero-Day Protection employs threat emulation and threat extraction capabilities that provide comprehensive protection from the most dangerous attacks.â</p>
