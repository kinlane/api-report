<p><a href="https://www.xactlycorp.com">Xactly</a>, (NYSE:XTLY), a leading provider of cloud-based incentive solutions, today announced pre-built integrations with Salesforce through the Xactly Connect&trade; Open Platform. Enabling a seamless flow of data and extending functionality between Salesforce and Xactly, customers can get the intelligence they need to power better selling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Combining these solutions makes sales teams more efficient and effective,&rdquo; said Ron Rasmussen, CTO and SVP of Engineering, Xactly Corporation. &ldquo;By empowering customers to connect information and processes in their Salesforce ecosystem, they can get a better view of how to structure deals, serve customers, motivate reps and drive performance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For instance, through the integration, Salesforce customers can place the Xactly Incentive Estimator, a Salesforce Lightning component, directly into their Salesforce dashboard to run &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; scenarios on deals. This allows reps to model how every change in a deal structure impacts their compensation while enabling the company to encourage selling behavior that is in-line with corporate objectives.</p>
<p>Similarly, Salesforce Wave&nbsp;Analytics users can pull in essential information from Xactly, analyze it and deliver insights via custom reports. This provides stakeholders a holistic view of sales performance &ndash; from the initial point of contact, through to the commission payment.</p>
<p>In addition, users can automatically load critical data directly from Salesforce into their Xactly Incent<sup>TM </sup>software to gain an immediate, accurate picture of their sales environment. For example, sales hierarchy data is essential when granting information access, as well as structuring compensation payments. However, it&rsquo;s also data that quickly changes and becomes outdated. With the Xactly Connect integration, customers can pull this data, as well as opportunity information and orders, from Salesforce into Xactly Incent as frequently as they desire.</p>
<p>These are early examples of how the Xactly Connect Open Platform can link Salesforce data with other Xactly services to achieve more effective selling, shorter cycle times and improved rep engagement.

<p>The announcement was made today at Dreamforce, the world&rsquo;s largest cloud event. Attendees can visit Gold-sponsor Xactly in Moscone South, booth #1719 to see the power of these integrations in action.</p>
