This release brings instant, automated, written explanations from Wordsmith side-by-side with Tableauâs beautiful data visualizations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Companies depend on Tableau to help them see and understand their data and make decisions that impact their business. Tableau is focused on making it easy for customers to discover trends and meaningful insights, which is what makes the integration with Wordsmith a natural extension of the Tableau experience.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe natural language capabilities of Wordsmith will be a fantastic addition to our dashboards,â said David Boyle, Executive Vice President Insight at BBC Worldwide. âIt will allow us to get more people using data to make more decisions by cutting to the chase and telling people what they need to know, rather than relying on them to work it out by interpreting charts.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Companies like BBC Worldwide often rely on data experts to write weekly summaries of dashboards. These experts could move on to higher value analysis if they werenât busy with this repetitive work. Other companies that donât have experts available to write this commentary, or enough time to write it, leave employees and executives wasting time interpreting dashboards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Today, Automated Insights and Tableau are fixing both problems with the release of an integration between the Wordsmith natural language generation API and Tableau web dashboardsâ getData() API. For the first time, your teamâs best data experts can design an NLG template that automatically explains whatâs happening in a Tableau dashboard. Executives get a concise explanation of events, while the experts move on to higher value analysis.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Tableau users can tailor the Wordsmith template to reveal what executives care about, using the companyâs voice and language. Since the narratives capture the expertise of your team, you get specific cause-and-effect understanding of all charts in a complex dashboard, rather than the generic, out-of-context description of a single chart given by other natural language generation providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe new developer APIs in Tableau 10 have made it possible for partners to extend the possibilities with Tableau,â said Francois Ajenstat, Chief Product Officer at Tableau. âAutomated Insights is bringing the power of NLG to Tableau, making data, charts and dashboards more accessible to more people and providing a faster path to insights for our customers.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Because Wordsmith has the worldâs only open API for natural language generation, Tableau customers can start adding commentary to dashboards right now with a free trial. Paid plans start at $250 a month. Or, if your team doesnât have data analysts available, Automated Insightsâ team of data scientists can build an automated commentary of your Tableau visualization for you.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"We have already helped some of our Fortune 100 customers build narratives around their Tableau dashboards,â said Adam Smith, Chief Revenue Officer at Automated Insights. "This new integration with Tableau 10 gives our customers the option of building their own custom explanations using the Tableau and Wordsmith APIs.â</p>
