<p><a href="http://mywebgrocer.com/">MyWebGrocer</a>, a leading provider of e-commerce and digital marketing solutions to the grocery and Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) industries, has partnered with MasterCard to introduce more grocers on its recently announced Groceries by MasterCard app. Groceries will enable consumers to purchase groceries through the Samsung Family Hub refrigerator, making grocery shopping easier and more convenient.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">MasterCard&rsquo;s Groceries app will help consumers streamline their grocery shopping routines. Households can build, share, manage and modify shopping lists, place orders and make payments through a seamless, collaborative interface. The app stores payment and delivery information in one convenient, secure location so that consumers don&rsquo;t have to re-enter personal information for every transaction.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The Internet of Things is revolutionizing commerce in every aspect of our lives, from the coffee shop to our own homes,&rdquo; said Eric Healy, MyWebGrocer president. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always been committed to improving the way consumers shop for groceries and now we&rsquo;re focusing on new and emerging technologies, such as the IoT and connected devices. Our partnership with MasterCard, a leader in global payments, enables us to propel the grocery industry into the next generation of customer experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Groceries app will analyze families&rsquo; shopping habits to make personalized suggestions for future purchases. Other features will be added, including recipe and video integration, and MyWebGrocer will introduce additional grocers on the app to give consumers a variety of brands to choose from.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;By leveraging our Digital Experience Platform&rsquo;s open, API centric capabilities, we&rsquo;re giving consumers the power to transact directly in the center of their meal planning &ndash; the kitchen,&rdquo; continued Healy. &ldquo;We look forward to paving the way for a more connected future and improving consumers&rsquo; grocery shopping experiences, from recipe collection and list building to ordering and delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;MasterCard is excited to partner with MyWebGrocer as we look to scale and grow the network of grocers,&rdquo; said Betty DeVita, chief commercial officer at MasterCard Labs. &ldquo;With more than 16 years of experience working with the top grocers and CPG brands, MyWebGrocer has the reach and industry acumen to help drive the successful expansion and use of Groceries throughout the U.S. and internationally.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Samsung Family Hub refrigerator was introduced at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show and will be available for purchase in the U.S. in May of 2016.</p>
