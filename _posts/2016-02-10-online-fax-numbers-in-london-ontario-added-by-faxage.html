<p><a href="http://www.faxage.com/">FAXAGE</a>, the value-leader in online fax services, has recently announced availability of local fax numbers in London, Ontario. FAXAGE is expanding its offerings as far as local fax number service capability in Canada.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to this latest expansion to London, Ontario, FAXAGE offers local Internet Fax numbers in all 48 states in the csorrontinental United States, Washington D.C., Alaska, Toronto,  Ontario and Hamilton, Ontario.

<p class="responsiveNews">FAXAGE offers both incoming and outgoing email fax, online fax and API faxing services. Faxes sent to a subscriber&rsquo;s local or toll-free online fax number are translated into PDF files and emailed to the subscriber.

Due to economies of scale, FAXAGE is able to offer these services for far less than the cost of a fax machine and phone line &ndash; with plans starting from as low as $3.49 per month. Full pricing options are available at the FAXAGE Internet Fax Pricing page.</p>
