<p>The latest release of Corepoint Integration Engine includes the ability for healthcare providers to transmit and receive patient data using HL7 FHIR, a health data standard that is poised to &ldquo;modernize&rdquo; how health IT applications access and exchange data. HL7 FHIR (pronounced &ldquo;fire&rdquo;) is based on technology used outside of healthcare by leading organizations such as Amazon, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">HL7 FHIR is an open-source standard developed by HL7 International. The new FHIR standard utilizes RESTful Web Service APIs (application program interface) and is based on modular components called &ldquo;resources.&rdquo; These resources can be combined to solve clinical and administrative problems in a practical way that are also more accessible to patient-facing mobile applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Major enhancements in version 2016.1 of Corepoint Integration Engine include:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>RESTful web services </strong><br />Corepoint Health customers now can implement the emerging HL7 FHIR standard using the industry&rsquo;s leading integration engine, Corepoint Integration Engine. Enhancements extend current web services capabilities to natively support REST, allowing more flexibility and peace of mind when connecting to APIs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Remote database support </strong><br />Enhancements allow customers to leverage their existing SQL Server infrastructure to unify log files to access Assured Availability, Corepoint Health&rsquo;s high availability feature.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Disaster Recovery functionality </strong><br />The DR option in Corepoint Integration Engine provides complete coverage for outages at a remote location. Whenever a disaster occurs, the user simply restores the latest saved repository and starts the backup version of Corepoint Integration Engine, allowing the DR site to exchange data as soon as other applications are ready.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Action List enhancements </strong><br />The Action List feature underwent key enhancements including formatting improvements, the ability to rename variables and message handles, and the ability to convert actions on the fly.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Joe Hamilton, a beta tester for version 2016.1 and the technical and operations team lead at UnityPoint Health, is particularly excited about the updates to the Action List because they significantly simplify his daily interfacing activities.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Corepoint Health does a great job by continuously updating their products to make our jobs easier. I really like how Action List syntax highlighting now makes it easier to locate downstream problems that may occur if I alter a workflow. Something as simple as the ability to automatically rename the message handles really saves us a lot of time. Before, we had to do a search for the variable and rename it in every location,&rdquo; Hamilton said. &ldquo;Bottom line, this update really shows how much Corepoint Health listens to their customers with the intent on making interoperability and modifying workflows an easy process.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Corepoint Health customers are encouraged to upgrade to version 2016.1 to keep their use of Corepoint Integration Engine current and to reap the benefits of the new data exchange standards and product features. More details for download are available in Corepoint Health's User Community.</p>
