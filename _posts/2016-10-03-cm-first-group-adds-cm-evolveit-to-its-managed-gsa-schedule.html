Now, the latest CM First product, CM evolveIT, has been added to the managed GSA schedule which means that government agencies will find it easy to be able to take advantage of this exciting, new product. http://www.cmfirstgroup.com/government/</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âGetting evolveIT on the GSA schedule was critical to CM First plans,â said Roger Hammer, CM evolveIT Product Manager. âGovernment agencies often canât buy a product that isnât on the GSA list, which can really slow modernization efforts. Every citizen is a âcustomerâ of the government, so itâs important to ensure that an agency can opt for terrific products.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For enterprise mainframe development organizations around the world, evolveIT represents an integral part of the DevOps process by enterprise mainframe development organizations. For many, the big challenges â improving code quality, reducing time-to-market and modernizing legacy applications â seem like too big and risky a project. Itâs difficult to understand code that might have been written 20 years ago and the programming languages of that era donât make it easy to find the business rules defining business processes. Attempting this as a manual effort will take too much time and be quite costly; itâs also quite risky.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">evolveIT eliminates all those issues by automating the process and assuring that all business rules, even those spanning applications and platforms can be detected and documented. With this information, web and mobile-enablement become achievable. Customers use CM evolveIT to perform the following functions:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Harvest business rules for system modernization</li>
<li>Perform detailed impact analysis for mass change, for example, increasing a column size</li>
<li>Visualize data flows and lineages</li>
<li>Improve code quality by managing complexity and removing dead code</li>
<li>Automatically document legacy systems</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new capabilities provided by CM evolveIT enhance CM First initiatives around modernization and mobile-enablement.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âAny development projects the corporation faces will be expedited and improved with a clear understanding of business rules,â said Hammer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">CM First chose to partner with Winvale, because Winvale channel partners can leverage the contract to sell products to government customers when the company doesnât have its own GSA contract. Many governmental agencies will only buy from the GSA schedule because the schedule ensures that the companies listed are vetted, approved and known to provide a quality product or service.</p>
