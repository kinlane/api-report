<p><a href="http://www.trumpia.com">Trumpia</a>, the leading mobile messaging and cross-channel marketing automation software provider, today announced three new updates.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Salesforce Integration: Trumpia announced that they have teamed up with Salesforce, a leading cloud-based CRM platform, and released the first of many integration plans they have with the company. Users can now set it up so that whenever a contact subscribes for their messaging campaigns through either a mobile keyword or an online sign-up page they create with Trumpia, they can also have it automatically added as a lead in Salesforce.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Visual Verification Code: Trumpia added to their continued efforts to strengthen the security of their software for both themselves and their users. Now, users can choose to add CAPTCHAs to online sign up pages. These randomly generated visual verification codes prevent scamming machines from filling out the forms.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Send Pics and Videos: The final update in this patch lets users send picture and video messages through the mobile app, much like the MMS feature that already exists in Trumpia&rsquo;s software. Videos especially have seen a recent uptick in use due to their effectiveness in generating sales.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&ldquo;A recent study found that 64% of consumers said that they were more likely to purchase a product after viewing a video about it,&rdquo; said Trumpia&rsquo;s CEO, Ken Rhie. &ldquo;This points to the unparalleled ability of videos to explain an otherwise complex idea.&rdquo;</em></p>
