<p><a href="https://www.inkshares.com.">Inkshares</a> will integrate with <a href="http://kadaxis.com">Kadaxis'</a> data analysis APIs to determine industry standard BISAC categories, topics and other data from author manuscripts. The extracted data will be used as input to Inkshares' own discovery platform, helping to match manuscripts with titles from outside the Inkshares ecosystem. Readers will be able to find similar Inkshares books to titles they already enjoy.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The partnership allows Inkshares to leverage Kadaxis' machine learning research and technology, to uncover data elements within manuscripts in an automated, real-time manner that wouldn't be possible through manual curation.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"At Kadaxis we use data science to uncover insights about books from their content and audience. Our goal is to use these insights to create better connections between readers and books. The number of books published each day is increasing, and it has become highly challenging for publishers and authors to improve their book's visibility online in a meaningful way," said Chris Sim, CEO and founder of Kadaxis. "Inkshares is an innovative tech-forward publisher, who's helping to solve this problem for their authors through a new discovery platform. Kadaxis is thrilled to partner with Inkshares to provide the manuscript analysis capability behind their new product.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We met the team at Kadaxis last year in NYC. Our goal in 2016 is to focus on reader onboarding, and we immediately thought of Kadaxis as a company that could help relate Inkshares books to others that readers are already familiar with. Both Inkshares and Kadaxis are technology-based companies that are determined to solve hard problems in publishing. We see a lot of synergy with this relationship,&rdquo; said Jeremy Thomas, CEO and co-founder of Inkshares.</p>
