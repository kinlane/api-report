<p>In a revolutionary innovation for tactical communications, Stauder Technologies in collaboration with Aeronix, Inc. is pleased to announce the introduction of mobileJECL&trade;, a digital communications suite representing the next generation of mobile battlefield technology. Connecting tactical radios directly to Android devices using Aeronix&rsquo;s mobileIDM&trade; software modem, mobileJECL&trade; eliminates the need for hardware modems and their associated cables.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">mobileJECL&trade; allows US and Coalition dismounted Fires Operators (e.g. Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs), Joint Fires Observers (JFOs), etc.) to directly connect their tactical fires application on an Android device to tactical radios, drastically improving SWaP (Size, Weight and Power) ratios and decreasing system complexity. mobileJECL&trade; is DACAS Block I compliant and delivers interoperability with capable aircraft directly from an Android end-user device. In addition to supporting legacy and modern messaging protocols (VMF, AFAPD, Link-16, SADL, CoT), this advanced capability also provides next-generation functionality like XNPv2 and support for Network Enabled Weapons.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For VMF over Combat Net Radio communications, Stauder's software is enabled by mobileIDM&trade; from Aeronix, the recognized leader in tactical software modem technology. mobileIDM&trade; is a newly released software modem for Android, based on Aeronix 's highly successful WinIDM&trade; software modem fielded in many US and Coalition JTAC ground kits as well as US Joint Forces validation tools.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Operators want less equipment and more capability," said Stauder Technologies founder Jerry Stauder. "We hear you. This solution is in response to warfighters who are burdened with heavy, power-eating equipment. mobileJECL&trade;, paired with Aeronix&rsquo;s mobileIDM&trade;, delivers the capability and reliability you expect at a fraction of the development time and cost."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"This is what innovation is all about," said Aeronix President Jeff Fisher. "Aeronix prides itself in delivering highly reliable customer-specific solutions, and we are thrilled to collaborate with Stauder Technologies and its legacy as a premier provider of digital interoperability solutions for the military."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">mobileJECL&trade; is built on Stauder Technologies' pedigree of proven TRL 9 technologies that have been extensively tested and widely fielded throughout US DoD and coalition services. mobileJECL&trade; is grounded in Stauder&rsquo;s JECL&reg; (Joint Effects Coordination Link) their digital interoperability and peripheral management software core. JECL&reg; has been tested, validated and fielded by multiple US DoD ground and air programs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to the warfighter benefits, mobileJECL&trade; provides a rich API that allows you to quickly and easily integrate DACAS, ground fires, and situational awareness communications into your own application. mobileJECL&trade; is end-user device / radio agnostic, simplifying access to tactical peripherals, protocols and networks.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The mobileJECL&trade; solution is already integrated with fielded mobile warfighting applications like ATAK (Android Tactical Assault Kit) and A-PASS (Android &ndash; Precision Assault Strike Suite).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Founded in 1997 near St. Louis, Missouri, Stauder Technologies delivers industry-leading software and hardware to integrate land, air and sea platforms to exchange critical information across harsh environments.
