<p>Property maintenance and inspection reporting software, <a href="http://propertyinspect.com">PropertyInspect.com</a>, has today released its brand new property inspection app for iOS and Android. The app has been redesigned to reduce even more time and administration from the production of professional and detailed reports for the property industry.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Managing director Steve Rad said: &ldquo;Redesigning the app has been an exciting process for us. When we first created Property Inspect we were working mostly with landlords and rental agents to provide the system they wanted for residential inspections, move ins and move outs.  Now we have thousands of users spread across an array of vertical markets including estate agents, property managers, building inspectors and hotel and resort chains.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">As the popularity of the system has grown, Property Inspect has continually sought a variety of user feedback and has now incorporated it into the redesign to benefit both existing and new users.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The redesign has numerous usability improvements including a brand new interface and improved functionality.  We&rsquo;ve upgraded almost every aspect of the app to streamline the overall user experience and save users time when report producing.  Property Inspect is now one of the most widely-used property inspection products in the world and we looking forward to users reaping the benefits,&rdquo; concluded Steve.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Specific areas improved include a closer experience to the award-winning online report builder, a re-designed report preview system, better syncing, a more powerful dictionary autosuggest system, advanced checklists, audio dictation and even video. The app also makes things easier for people in the field with quick text shortcuts, swiping, dragging and side-by-side observations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Steve added: &ldquo;This generation of our mobile app has really given Property Inspect an edge over other products that fail to offer the flexibility required for such a diverse industry of property professionals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Property Inspect was designed to make creating, scheduling and comparing property move in/out and inspection reports in the field as fast and streamlined as possible. A complete end-to-end solution, the software allows the user to create detailed inventories, move ins, move outs, inspections and risk assessments including photos, numbered and referenced to make it clear for readers. It also provides a booking system for clients, assigns visits to team members and is fully customisable to slot right into an individual or companies existing workflow.</p>
