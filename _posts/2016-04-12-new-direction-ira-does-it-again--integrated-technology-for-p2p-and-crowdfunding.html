<p>Current functionality allowing fully integrated online platforms to offer investors an entirely seamless experience is now improved to include systematic additional investments in new or existing assets.   From a single integrated platform investors may open a new account, fund not just initial transactions but also subsequent transactions, as well as receive investment earnings or payouts.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="https://newdirectionira.com/home">New Direction IRA</a> is also launching The Alternative Gateway Integrated Technology portal NewDirectionIRA.com/TAGIT with details for adding integrated access to plan investments and for development against our industry standard OAuth authentication secured API Methods.  OAuth is an authorization framework that enables applications to securely obtain limited access to user accounts.  The Apiary- based documentation environment is available for application developers to immediately begin building against.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With TAGIT, online markets can totally integrate their platforms to include investor access to the trillions of dollars currently held in retirement, health savings, and other tax advantaged plans.  Diversification into multiple assets and dollar cost averaging is now a possibility, regardless of the dollar amounts or number of transactions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Investors and P2P platforms demand both the ability to diversify and smooth transaction processing&rdquo; says New Direction CEO Bill Humphrey.  &ldquo;Over our 13 years in business, investor needs have evolved to require more automation and sophistication and we continually improve our technology to meet those needs.  The P2P market is based on speed and efficiency. If you can&rsquo;t do it fast, don&rsquo;t bother, because the opportunity will be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Starting with the 2013 launch of the Self-Directed IRA industry&rsquo;s first paperless new account application, New Direction has steadily added integration options for account owners as well as the growing P2P market.  The 2014 addition of online bill payments and online receipts was focused on real estate and note investors.  2015 saw the first fully integrated paperless transaction process allowing P2P sponsors to invite clients to invest via the P2P platform with the same speed as individual and company transactions.</p>
