<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Automated Office 365 Governance and Protection</strong><br />By providing end-users with an intuitive service catalog of all available resources, DocAve Governance Automation Online resolves ambiguity around requesting resources from IT and encourages adoption throughout the content lifecycle. With DocAve Governance Automation Online, Office 365 administrators can now easily manage Office 365 Groups â one of Microsoftâs most talked-about recent features for cloud-based collaboration â while ensuring all user requests are handled quickly and according to organizational policy. New features include:Â </p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Office 365 Group Lifecycle Management: Office 365 administrators can create and enforce governance policies for Office 365 Groups â including the ability to determine who can request groups, whether or not external users can join, and a lease timeline for when Groups will be de-provisioned to avoid content sprawl. Requests for new groups, changes to existing groups, and lifecycle operations for expiring groups are routed through business-appropriate approval processes and executed automatically upon approval.</li>
<li>User Lifecycle Management: Office 365 administrators can provide end users with the ability to request provisioning and de-provisioning of Office 365 users, which is especially valuable to retail and other organizations with seasonal employees. User policies defined in the request allow for appropriate selection of Office 365 license types or user options, and can even trigger automatic de-provisioning of users after their contract term expires. As with Groups, all user requests are subject to dynamic approval processes and automatically executed once approved.</li>
</ul>

With AvePoint Cloud Insights, organizations can gain actionable insights around Office 365 through audit and report data from across the platform as well as sources including the Activity Management and Office Graph APIs. Features include:Â </p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Storage Reports: Site owners and Office 365 administrators can observe trends in content â including details down to the item level and analysis on content composition â in order to accurately monitor storage quotas.</li>
<li>Site Analytics, User, and Activity Reports: Site owners and administrators can identify their most valuable content contributors and consumers so that they can better manage and guide the direction of their content relative to the rest of the enterprise.</li>
<li>Content Reports: Administrators and power users can understand on what trends are occurring within the Office 365 tenant and its content, including what documents are trending, what the top content is, and how it ranks relative to other documents and files within the organization.</li>
<li>Security Trimming: Administrators can control which report types Cloud Insights users can access and the scope from which data is retrieved and displayed to the end user. This ensures that data is only in the hands of those who should have access and out of the hands of those who shouldnât.</li>
<li>Account Filters: Administrators can filter out service and test accounts that can skew reports to provide only the most accurate data around Office 365 usage.</li>
</ul>
