<p><a href="http://runscope.com">Runscope</a> has been helping thousands of developers and platform providers with robust cloud-based API testing, monitoring and debugging tools. Users of Runscope Radar have been able to created automated API tests for Internet-accessible backend services, complete with assertions and multiple testing locations around the world. However, many companies have APIs that live solely behind a firewall, only accessible from within the private network.</p>
<p>Runscope now offers the <a href="https://www.runscope.com/docs/radar/agent">Runscope Radar On-premises Agent</a>, bridging Runscope to private APIs not available over the public internet. By running the agent within a private infrastructure, Runscope Radar can now monitor and test against endpoints that are otherwise inaccessible through the internet. The agent is particularly useful for testing or monitoring APIs in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Monitoring private or internal APIs</b> that reside behind a firewall</li>
<li>Testing APIs on <b>localhost</b> or in a private staging environment</li>
<li>Accessing APIs that require a <b>fixed client IP address</b> (IP whitelisting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Runscope Radar uses a <b>hybrid on-premises</b> approach. The agent runs on a host within the private infrastructure, but test data is managed and stored in the Runscope cloud. The Runscope dashboard serves as a single interface for defining tests, viewing results, configuring notifications and enabling 3rd-party integrations. All communication between the agent and Runscope cloud is made securely via HTTPS. The agent requests work to be processed and sends results back over a TLS-encrypted connection and is not externally addressable. The agent is available for download, and can be run natively on the following operating systems: Mac OS X, Windows (32-bit / 64-bit) and Linux (32-bit / 64-bit).</p>
