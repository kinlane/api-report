<p class="responsiveNews">âAdding this automation to the already robust PoliWall/ProACT Threat Intelligence Platform, gives the small to mid-sized enterprise an essential weapon in the ongoing battle against cyber-attack and data leakage,â says Brian Peterson, COO/CFO Bandura. âFor example, we have a banking customer who is required to block a list of malicious IP addresses provided by the FBI. The customer was putting rules into the firewall by hand to accommodate the frequently updated mandate, which is labor-intensive and slow. With PoliWall, the customer just opens the block list screen and imports the list(s) they want auto-updated and auto-blockedâliterally set it and forget it!â <br />PoliWall/ProACT Threat Intelligence Platform with advanced filtering provides the highest level of automated security without slowing down the network. Beginning with PoliWallâs best in class country blocking with granular exceptions. Bandura added ProACTâs automation of multiple sources of threat intelligenceâenriching the intelligence to make it relevant to the customerâs own network. The unified threat feed enters the PoliWall which automatically blocks threats, both inbound and outbound, according to your acceptable level of risk, using an intuitive dial-up/dial-down risk management dashboard. ProACT also allows real-time threat information sharing with other PoliWalls in the network stopping cyber threats in near real-time at each PoliWall node. <br />ProACT can run on any machine in a customerâs network, as well as in a public or private cloud, and has an open SDK and rest API for network device integration.</p>
