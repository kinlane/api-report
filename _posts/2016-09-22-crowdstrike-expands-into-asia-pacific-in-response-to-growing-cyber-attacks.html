<p><a href="http://www.crowdstrike.com">CrowdStrike Inc.</a>, the leader in cloud-delivered next-generation endpoint        protection, threat intelligence and response services, today announced        the launch of its operations in Asia Pacific (APAC) by establishing a        physical presence in Australia. Coming off the back of robust customer        and partner growth momentum globally, the move will cement CrowdStrike&rsquo;s        position as the leader in the next-generation endpoint protection market        within the APAC region and facilitate new business development efforts.</p>
<p>The strategic decision to expand CrowdStrike&rsquo;s presence into APAC        follows a US$100 million Series C funding, led by Google Capital in        2015. Other existing investors include Warburg Pincus, Accel and        Rackspace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CrowdStrike is seeing significant growth in APAC, and Australia in        particular is an extremely important market for us,&rdquo; said George Kurtz,        CrowdStrike&rsquo;s co-founder and chief executive officer. &ldquo;In addition to        our strong global customer portfolio, we have also witnessed rapidly        growing demand for our industry-leading next-generation endpoint        protection platform. We are the only company that has successfully        unified next-generation antivirus and endpoint detection and response        (EDR) through a fully cloud-based, API-driven platform, which allows        customers unrivalled capabilities to stop existing and emerging threats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Telstra among its client roster in Australia, affirming its        physical presence in the region will allow CrowdStrike to accommodate        and accelerate the exponential global demand for the CrowdStrike        Falcon&trade; next-generation endpoint protection platform. Recently, the        company introduced powerful new features that enhance its Falcon        platform, including new APIs, CrowdStrike        Falcon Orchestrator and next-generation antivirus with new        ransomware protection capabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The CrowdStrike technology is providing a unique value to Telstra in        its ability to detect and stop zero day exploits, malware attacks, along        with hacker activity and ransomware, all of which go undetected by        legacy security technologies,&rdquo; said Mike Burgess, chief information        security officer, Telstra. &ldquo;Telstra relies on CrowdStrike&rsquo;s combination        of technology, people and intelligence to protect against the most        sophisticated threats and help keep our customers' data safe and        networks secure. CrowdStrike Falcon's next-generation threat prevention        capabilities, its DVR-like endpoint detection and response features,        aided by the elite Falcon Overwatch managed hunting team, has proved its        value to us time and again,&rdquo; Burgess added.</p>
<p><strong>Appointments<br /></strong>Mike Sentonas has been appointed as vice president of technology        strategy to spearhead CrowdStrike&rsquo;s APAC go-to-market efforts and        oversee the company&rsquo;s growing customer and partner network. Sentonas        will report to CrowdStrike co-founder and chief technology officer        Dmitri Alperovitch. Sentonas was most recently chief technology and        strategy officer Asia Pacific at Intel Security. Prior to that, he was        vice president and worldwide chief technology officer of Security        Connected at Intel Security.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CrowdStrike&rsquo;s expansion into the APAC region comes at a time when the        CrowdStrike Falcon platform is leading the charge in revolutionising        endpoint security,&rdquo; said Mike Sentonas, vice president of technology        strategy. &ldquo;The opportunity to work with George and Dmitri and the team        they have built at CrowdStrike is incredibly exciting. Their focus is to        stop breaches and the team is on a mission to challenge the traditional        thinking in security and innovate to solve customer problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to appointing Sentonas, CrowdStrike has made other strategic        hires to support regional growth, including the appointment of Simon        Walker as senior director of marketing, APAC. Walker was previously        director of marketing, APAC at Forcepoint.</p>
