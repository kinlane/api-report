<p>Despite its rapid rise in usage and popularity, mobile marketing &ndash; especially legacy mobile technologies like SMS text messaging -- remains a mystery to many marketers, according to a new survey commissioned by <a href="http://www.irio.com">IRIO</a>, developer of one of the first SaaS mobile messaging platforms more than 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Interviews with over 200 marketing executives conducted by a user experience research firm found that SMS/MMS messaging is not a conventional tactic used for prospecting and customer engagement. Yet mobile messaging &mdash; particularly SMS &mdash; has the broadest reach and highest adoption among mobile users, according to a recent Business Insider report.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"As people get numb to social and e-mail, messaging is still the unpolluted medium," says Matt Mazzeo, a Lowercase Capital managing director. "It hasn't yet been diluted by massive spammy marketing channels."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SMS/MMS marketing is highly regulated in order to protect consumers and deter spamming, according to Russell Davis, IRIO&rsquo;s CEO. &ldquo;Surveys have found that only about 10% of SMS marketing messages received are considered spam. This is probably because users must opt-in to receive your message.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The average person has their mobile phone within three feet of them 24/7, and they look at that phone at least 150 times a day. People worldwide will send 8.3 trillion SMS messages in just this year alone. That&rsquo;s almost 23 billion messages per day, according to Portio Research.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">During the IRIO survey, the marketing executives were exposed to mind-numbing statistics about SMS messaging, including an average read rate of 98 percent, versus an average open rate of 20 percent for email.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additionally, business Facebook posts organically only reach 16 percent of a company&rsquo;s audience; and Twitter acknowledges the need to tweet at least 14 to 21 times in a week in hopes of engaging 30 percent of a target audience. At the same time, Responsys says 66 percent of consumers subscribed to mobile marketing indicate that they have made a purchase as a result of receiving a highly relevant mobile message.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;I think text message marketing would be a fine vehicle for a known cohort,&rdquo; said a vice president of a major B2B software company. &ldquo;Great use cases for SMS for us would be people who have registered for an event, or downloaded a piece of content - so as a next step in a nurturing program. SMS certainly has a place. Because I know the company, I&rsquo;m having conversations with the company, I&rsquo;m engaging with the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A leader in the mobile messaging space for over a decade, IRIO recently rebranded its <a title="SMS/MMS solutions for tough business issues" onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly9pcmlvLmNvbS9uZWVkcy8=">website</a> to emphasize SMS/MMS solutions for tough business issues like:</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">An IRIO survey participant, the vice president of marketing at an aerospace engineering company said, &ldquo;I think if there is customization, I believe that will give a lot of personalization to text messaging, and that would make a big difference to us, because we would be able to target specific groups.&rdquo;</p>
