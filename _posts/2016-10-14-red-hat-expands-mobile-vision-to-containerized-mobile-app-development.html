<p><a href="http://www.redhat.com">Red Hat, Inc.</a> (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open source solutions, today announced the release of Red Hat Mobile Application Platform as a fully containerized offering designed to run in any public cloud, private cloud or on-premise infrastructure that supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Together with Red Hat's existing SaaS-based mobile app platform, enterprises now have a wider set of deployment options to integrate, manage, and scale their mobile app initiatives to meet their business objectives.</p>
<p>The move to a fully containerized platform, Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, based on docker-format containers and Kubernetes, is part of Red Hat's strategy to provide a single, integrated platform for modern application development that is cloud native, mobile-centric, microservices-based, and API-driven. This new generation of app development tools also support DevOps and agile processes to help businesses innovate and respond to the ever-changing needs of the digital enterprise.</p>
<p>Deployment of Red Hat Mobile Application Platform on OpenShift provides a common platform to support mobile workloads running alongside traditional enterprise applications that need to be moved to the cloud. With the new option for a fully supported on-premise deployment capability, customers can meet their specific management, regulatory and policy requirements for their mobile solutions.</p>
<p>In keeping with its commitment to open source, Red Hat also announced the availability of workforce management (WFM) modules as a tech preview, based on the open source FeedHenry RainCatcher community project. These JavaScript and Node.js-based modules can help speed the creation of customized mobile workforce management solutions that automate, optimize and simplify field workforce processes. Using the modules, organizations can compose mobile apps more quickly and easily to drive greater efficiency in field workforce operations.</p>
