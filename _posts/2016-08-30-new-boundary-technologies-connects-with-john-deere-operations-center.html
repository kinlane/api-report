<p>New Boundary Technologies announced today that its <a href="http://www.remoteaware.com">RemoteAware</a>&trade; Internet of Things (IoT) application platform is now connected to the John Deere Operations Center through John Deere&rsquo;s API services. This connection gives farmers and service providers alerts in the Operations Center when remote assets require attention based on sensor readings that exceed user-defined thresholds.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The RemoteAware IoT application platform can monitor and control a broad range of sensors and equipment, including:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>inventory levels of fuel, chemicals, water, and feed in tanks, bins and silos</li>
<li>water and energy usage</li>
<li>irrigation equipment</li>
<li>barn environmental conditions</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">RemoteAware applications give near real-time visibility to sensor information and can be configured to send text, e-mail and voice messages when assets require attention. Now, alerts can also be generated in the Operations Center. A single click on the Operations Center alert message gives the user a complete view of the asset&rsquo;s status.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The number of sensors in agriculture is proliferating rapidly as growers produce more with fewer resources,&rdquo; said Kim Pearson, CEO of New Boundary Technologies. &ldquo;Farmers want to see all of their assets in a single view without needing to run dozens of applications. We are excited to add sensor alerts from the RemoteAware application platform to the John Deere Operations Center. Farmers can now manage alerts from their remote assets as a part of their Operations Center workflow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The RemoteAware integration with Operations Center is now available to sensor and equipment manufacturers, distributors, solution providers and system integrators.</p>
