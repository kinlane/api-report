<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to enhanced ease-of-use for business and technical users, the advancements to the platform allow 40 percent faster download of complex data sets in excess of 10 million rows. The turnkey solution is cloud ready and can be deployed in less than one hour.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additional new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A fully upgraded technology stack that is certified on Java 8Â </li>
<li>Enhanced REST web-service APIsÂ </li>
<li>Cloud-ready, advanced data profiling and channel readiness capabilities that enable end users to more quickly and easily identify and correct channel-specific data issuesÂ </li>
<li>User experience improvements such as the ability to intuitively manage language translations and localization not offered by any other MDM/PIM solutions</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Enable 8.2 solution is a multi-tenant application for use as a vendor portal, dealer portal and multi-enterprise data hub. Enable 8.2 also includes an advanced matching capability that allows for more accurate automated product classifications and the ability to automate the combinatorial âexplosionâ of SKUs based on variants and options; or, in reverse, group SKUs and automate the reduction of variants and options to the group or family level.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âEnterWorks continues to innovate and bring to market features that are redefining the MDM/PIM landscape. This innovation is a result of the flexibility of our dynamic, responsive architecture and the capital and resources provided by our investor, Black Dragon Capital,â said EnterWorks COO, Kerry Young. âThese ongoing advancements enable us to serve the largest, most complex customers while having the light touch necessary for mid-market and small businesses. Our platform can reduce the total cost of ownership compared to competing solutions while being best-in-class for our customersâ ability to master, manage and govern a single view of product content delivered through omnichannel touchpoints.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Enable 8.2 has received certification for successfully proving the âData Sourceâ and âData Recipientâ capabilities for GS1 GDSNÂ® Major Release 3 (MjR3). EnterWorks Enable 8.2 will be available for general release in July 2016.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"The new Java 8 based infrastructure allows Enable to fully exploit the performance and scalability of distributed cloud computing and offers a broad set of support options to help our customers maximize success, which include backup and recovery, auto-scaling and SAML2 security for worldwide distributed deployments,â said John Jones, Vice President of Product at EnterWorks. âWeâre excited to share this improved, next generation of the platform with our customers.â</p>
