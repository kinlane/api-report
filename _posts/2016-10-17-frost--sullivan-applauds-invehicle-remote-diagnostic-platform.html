<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/373162.jpeg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" />Based on its recent analysis of the in-vehicle scan tools market, Frost &amp; Sullivanrecognises&nbsp;Mobile Devices with the 2015 European Frost &amp; Sullivan Award for New Product Innovation. Mobile Device's Munic.io solution, powered by advanced technology and innovative proprietary algorithms, enables easy diagnosis of vehicle data by car users. The product is supported by an on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) dongle (the Munic.box) and a cloud platform, CloudConnect, to enable users to easily understand the vehicle's condition without the need for additional&nbsp;specialised&nbsp;scanning hardware tools.</p>

<p>"Mobile Devices has uniquely positioned its Munic.box dongle as an open platform for the scanning of every car manufactured after 1996. While the OBD-II port of vehicles provides data, the CloudConnect solution analyses the data collected in the cloud," said Frost &amp; Sullivan Research Analyst Swapnadeep Nayak. "The easy-to-install OBD-II dongle along with cloud connectivity makes it the ideal scan tool for car owners, irrespective of the car's vintage, brand, and segment."</p>
<p><strong>Mobile Devices</strong><br />Embedding a powerful ARM processor @664MHz and supported by wireless 2G, 3G, or 4G cellular communication, the Munic.io platform collects in-vehicle data and processes it onboard and remotely in a cloud platform, for real-time scanning. The most important part is the company's unique Multistack technology which allows the solution to:</p>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-sm-10 col-sm-offset-1">
<ul id="continue-jump" type="disc">
<li>Dynamically load the vehicle-specific part of the OBD stack in the device to automatically match the configuration of any light or heavy vehicle</li>
<li>Combine multiple original equipment&nbsp;manufacturer&nbsp;(OEM) stacks to offer the largest coverage of vehicles in the market</li>
<li>Multistack allows programming in a very simple way (through scripts)&nbsp;high level&nbsp;CAN or other vehicle stacks to interact with vehicle and retrieve real-time information</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from the in-device storage of 256 Mbytes to process application procedures, the platform's cloud has been designed to collect, process, store, and distribute the real-time data of millions of devices in the field. The platform's cloud already manages 350K+ devices daily. All electronic control unit (ECU) data from various sensors fitted in the vehicle are constantly&nbsp;synchronised&nbsp;at short intervals to ensure that Munic.io customers receive the latest information from their vehicles.</p>
<p>Importantly, Mobile Devices addresses the security issues inherent in in-vehicle scanning by supporting the transfer of data from the vehicle to the user's own secured servers through hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) post notification. The end-to-end is ensured through Mobile Devices' KryptX technology, where all sensitive data is encrypted and signed.</p>
<p>Mobile Devices has gained yet another competitive edge by creating a driver-profiling algorithm that leverages an inertial navigation system and accelerometer data to periodically compute the position of the vehicle while moving. The algorithm assigns a confidence index to each evaluation of location information and it predicts driver&nbsp;behaviour&nbsp;from the raw data.</p>
<p>Mobile Devices has shown remarkable vision in providing CloudSDK, a suite of programming tools that enable application developers in the connected car space to easily connect their innovative applications with the Munic.io solution. This gives application developers the flexibility to easily obtain in-vehicle data without worrying about the complexity of the ECU. Notably, Mobile Devices offers a&nbsp;catalogue&nbsp;of third-party telematics applications with the&nbsp;Munic.Box solution in addition to a range of free in-house services for integrators.</p>
<p>"Mobile Devices not only boasts a host of extra feature sets, such as free telematics applications, a device manager software suite, and many more features that are not available with other scan tool solution&nbsp;providers,&nbsp;but also keeps its solution's pricing competitive," noted Nayak. "Similarly,&nbsp;Munic.Box's strategy of extending its solution to meet vehicle standards across the world underlines its primary focus on customers' needs."</p>
<p>Overall, for understanding customer needs in the in-vehicle scan tools market and developing an innovative new product to address those needs, Frost &amp; Sullivan is pleased to present Mobile Devices with the 2015 European Frost &amp; Sullivan Award for New Product Innovation.</p>
<p>Each year, Frost &amp; Sullivan presents this award to the company that has developed an innovative element in a product by leveraging leading-edge technologies. The award&nbsp;recognises&nbsp;the value-added features/benefits of the product and the greater return on investment (ROI) it offers customers, which, in turn, improves customer acquisition and overall market penetration potential.</p>
<p>"Mobile Devices has&nbsp;done a remarkably good job of understanding customer needs in the&nbsp;vehicle scan tools industry&nbsp;and developing an innovative new product to address those needs,"&nbsp;said Frost &amp; Sullivan Global President &amp; Managing Partner,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Krishna Srinivasan</span>.&nbsp;'Its&nbsp;Munic.io&nbsp;Product'&nbsp;is uniquely positioned for sustained success because it addresses the core issues that customers care about&mdash;quality, functionality,&nbsp;and reliability."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frost &amp; Sullivan Best Practices awards&nbsp;recognise&nbsp;companies in a variety of regional and global markets for demonstrating outstanding achievement and superior performance in areas such as leadership, technological innovation, customer service, and strategic product development. Industry analysts compare market participants and measure performance through in-depth interviews, analysis, and extensive secondary research to identify best practices in the industry.</p>
