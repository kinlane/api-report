As part of the AppSpeed portfolio, Multi-page Predictive Prefetching and Mobile App Acceleration together improve the performance of every app, whether it is a desktop, mobile or native IOS or Android application.</p>
<p>Providing a near-instantaneous response to end users is becoming increasingly important across all delivery channels. According to Milan Hanson from Forrester, "When customers depend on mobile devices to visit your business, your mobile performance shapes their perception. And this trend is growing. Poor performance is poor performance, no matter what the cause, and your company will suffer for it.â</p>
<p><strong>Multi-page Predictive Prefetching</strong></p>
<p>Substantial developer time is spent optimizing landing pages and other main entry points into applications, with less time spent on subsequent pages, as the number of paths through the application can be large. Merely guessing in advance which page a user is going to click next and loading it in the background can result in wasted development time, wasted bandwidth and wasted system resources.</p>
<p>With Multi-page Predictive Prefetching, Instart Logicâs endpoint-aware application delivery solution observes where users land, models common flows from a given landing page, identifies static elements shared across potential pages, and pushes the common resources to the browser. As a result, instead of sitting idle, the browser can enable much faster loading of subsequent pages, providing a better user experience.</p>
<p>âUsing the tremendous amount of user behavior data we analyze across millions of sessions with our machine learning algorithms in the cloud, we can apply additional performance optimizations that improve the experience throughout a user's journey,â explains Shailesh Shukla, CMO and VP of Products at Instart Logic. âMulti-page Predictive Prefetching leverages our proprietary endpoint-aware Nanovisor technology to identify the best content to prefetch. â</p>
<p><strong>Mobile App Acceleration</strong></p>
<p>Mobile application user experience is directly correlated with wireless network performance. Slow loading apps lead to high rates of abandonment, which have an adverse effect on businesses relying on transactions and user engagement from mobile applications.</p>
<p>The Instart Logic Mobile App Acceleration SDK delivers last mile acceleration for native mobile applications. With a single API call made when the application is launched, the Mobile App Acceleration service intercepts all HTTP/HTTPS traffic, replacing TCP with Instart Logicâs proprietary Dynamic Packet Recovery (DPR) protocol. DPR uses a combination of forward error correction to recover lost packets, and adaptive rate control to improve throughput on WiFi and cellular links.</p>
<p>This unique combination of network layer and application layer optimizations is an industry first, and provides a massive boost in performance for mobile app traffic. âWeâve been using Instart Logicâs application delivery platform for over four years to accelerate API traffic from our iOS and Android appsâ, said Ori Zaltzman, Founder and CTO of Gogobot. âSince we integrated the mobile SDK, weâve seen a further reduction in the time to download objects and throughput improvements across WiFi, LTE, and 3G, improving user experience for our app â which has recently been selected as the Editorâs Choice in the Google Play Store.â</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<p>Multi-page Predictive Prefetching is now in beta. Mobile App Acceleration is generally available. Please contact the sales team or visit www.instartlogic.com for more information.</p>
