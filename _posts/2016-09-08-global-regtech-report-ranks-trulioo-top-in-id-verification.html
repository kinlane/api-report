<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_85861_better._faster._simpler.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.trulioo.com">Trulioo</a>, the leading global identity verification company, today announced that its flagship identity verification solution, GlobalGateway, was ranked first in the Verification Tools/Identity Checks category and third in the Overall Supplier Rankings in the 2016 RegTech Performance Report published by Market Fintech Limited.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The report estimates that more 189 global financial institutions have deployed a range of new RegTech solutions from 20-plus technology suppliers across a range of compliance activities from transaction monitoring and automated regulatory reporting to instant identity validation and verification.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThis new performance report will be of particular interest to financial firms looking to adopt new regulatory technologies,â said Tina Snelling, CEO of Market Fintech Limited, which produced the report. âInstitutions often struggle to answer questions that regulators may pose because their systems werenât designed for that purpose.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Developed for the global market, GlobalGateway, helps business comply with a diverse range of identity verification requirements, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe report brings valuable insight to an emerging, highly complex and critical area of financial technology,â said Jon Jones, President of Trulioo. âCompliance needs regulatory technology to efficiently and accurately automate the basic tasks, so that resources can be focused on policy, execution and system design."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Jones added, "Our product was built from the ground up to address AML and KYC compliance with transparency at top of mind â a critical and powerful component to achieve identity verification in a regulatory context.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Still in its early days, RegTech is made up of many best-of-breed solutions, often developed by veterans of the banking industry who identified a problem and wanted to devise a smart solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âEven the largest banks canât continue to hire tens of thousands of compliance staff; they need technology to help them meet the regulations,â said Jones. âInstant identity verification is a key step in providing legitimate banking services and the RegTech Performance Report will help increase the role that technology can play in compliance.â</p>
