</ul>
<p>Paul Lisiak, Managing Partner of Metropolitan stated, &ldquo;While the FinTech industry has experienced some recent headwinds, our confidence in both Bizfi and its place in the alternative financing industry has never been stronger. Since our original investment, Bizfi&rsquo;s management has proven month after month its ability to generate profits and growth in an industry where most companies are calculating burn rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bizfi and its proprietary marketplace and funding technologies have provided in excess of $1.7 billion in financing to more than 30,000 small businesses across the United States since 2005.
