<p class="responsiveNews">"Our goal at the end of the day is to ensure that our merchants realize every possible opportunity to make the sale," said Wolf Kring President ofÂ Alternative Payments.Â "We offer retailers worldwide the opportunity to maximize their shopsâ potential by opening it to the global marketplace. The launch of our innovative payment gateway is a win-win opportunity for web merchants who want new sales, and for international consumers who need a trusted checkout journey."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">E-commerce merchants currently relying on credit cards and PayPal are limiting their potential. These traditional payment types lack penetration in many countries, especially in the huge market of the EU. European consumers have opted to continue using the non-credit card payment options they have trusted for years.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Alternative Payments curates the top localized payment methods based on consumer preference and usage. This includesÂ EuroDebitÂ®/SEPA the only payment type available to all bank accountÂ holders in the EU. Merchants are on-boarded within minutes and in the driversâ seat with a robust new admin tool. This provides extensive reporting via the dashboard andÂ full controlÂ of the transaction lifecycle.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Regardless of the currencyÂ used or the preferred payment method, allÂ transactions are handled through a single secure platform. The platform provides merchants with flexible integration options. A single line of code makes use of the OneButton and the Payment Widget or developsÂ an entirely custom solution via the API. There are also third-party plugins available to work with many CMS, shopping carts, and frameworks.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Kring continued, "Credit cards are a must, however in a global marketplace they leave too many potential sales on the table. We understand that for a merchant who uses credit cards herselfÂ the potential for alternative payments may not be obvious. We have specialized in global payments for 15 years.Â Our goal this year is to make the adoption of alternative payments frictionless for e-commerce players. Our new systemÂ closes the gap between flipping the switch to turn on the massive potential of international buyers andÂ realizing newÂ sales at your business."</p>
