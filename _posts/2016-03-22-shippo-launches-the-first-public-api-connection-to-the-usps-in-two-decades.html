<p class="c0">Shippo (<span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goshippo.com/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1458698186955000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFgYpg-etCAd-v3hdaC75PWXvHYWg">https://goshippo.com/</a></span>), whose mission is to power shipping for businesses of all sizes, launched their USPS ePostage integration, making them one of the only public APIs for purchasing U.S. postage online - the first since 1999. Any business will be able to access the connection through Shippo&rsquo;s simple RESTful API, as part of the large network of shipping providers that they have built. Reliable access to USPS is especially important because the Postal Service&nbsp;is one of the&nbsp;most affordable shipping carrier in the U.S.This&nbsp;launch is just the first of many integrations that Shippo is building to shipping accessible, simple, and affordable for every business.</p>
<p class="c0">The U.S. Postal Service restricts the use of their API to an exclusive set of companies. Back in 1999, they certified a list of companies including Stamps.com, Endicia, and Pitney Bowes - called PC Postage vendors. Almost two decades later, USPS is opening up access again for new entrants in the market as part of their ePostage program.<span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://postalnews.com/postalnewsblog/2012/02/21/amazon-to-begin-using-epostage/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1458698186957000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEvpqjwjpm5DNbhShKT5dwjxUaaLQ">Amazon</a></span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="c6"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/cab/abn/y16/m01/i27/s02&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1458698186958000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE7UEOw1vT2RADBCkyaBNuzBA4rzg">Etsy</a></span>&nbsp;have acquired the permission to implement this technology exclusively for their merchants. Today, Shippo will be the first to launch ePostage for public access.</p>
<p class="c0">&ldquo;Our goal at Shippo is to build technology that help e-commerce businesses access simple and affordable shipping solutions.&rdquo; said Laura Behrens Wu, CEO and co-founder of Shippo. &ldquo;I am very excited to launch ePostage today because not only are we able to provide our customers with a simple integration with the USPS, but we are now able to actively control our customer experience, ensuring a stable and responsive environment for them to access affordable postage.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="c0">The small-parcel delivery market has grown to be worth $300 billion globally as the e-commerce industry grows 15% year-over-year. In 2015 alone, 8.5 billion packages&nbsp;were&nbsp;shipped around the world. Despite this massive market, many shipping providers do not have APIs, and those that do are overly complicated and difficult to use.</p>
<p class="c0">Shippo solves that problem. They give&nbsp;SMBs, marketplaces, platforms, and inventory management companies access to a network of shipping providers through a single RESTful API. By having access to multiple carriers, businesses can save money by using specialized shipping services for various shipment needs.</p>
<p class="c0">Along with USPS, Shippo supports over 15 shipping providers across North America, Europe, and Australia. Shippo also uses economies of scale to help their customers negotiate&nbsp;significant&nbsp;discounts, and provide businesses of any size with the same competitive advantages that a powerhouse like Amazon would have. In 2015, Shippo sent millions of packages to over 230 countries around the world. Their technology powers shipping for customers such as Shyp, Mercari, Cosmopolitan Cosmetics, GoDaddy, Weebly, and thousands of others.</p>
<p class="c0">Today, Shippo customers have the ability to access rates and services across carriers to identify the right service levels for their needs, manually. Over the next year,&nbsp;Shippo will start using the same logic to automatically suggest which specialized shipping services to use based on package information. &nbsp;</p>
