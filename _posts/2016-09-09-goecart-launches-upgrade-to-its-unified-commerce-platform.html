With over two hundred new features and enhancements, the all-in-one software targeted at midsized retailers and emerging brands combines an advanced unified commerce platform with increased security tools, Magento and Shopify integration, powerful reporting, intuitive user interface, ship-from-store, order fulfillment optimization and much more.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe new enhanced 360â¢ is the most comprehensive retail suite available for midmarket merchants and emerging brands,â says Manish Chowdhary, GoECart's CEO. âTodayâs merchants cannot ignore the fact that unified commerce is the future of e-commerce. They must adapt to changing customer expectations or will soon become obsolete and be surpassed by competitors.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The New Software Suite Offers:</p>
<ul>
<li>>Increased SecurityÂ </li>
<li>>Pre-Built Integration With Other Popular E-Commerce PlatformsÂ </li>
<li>>Intuitive Easy-To-Use User Interface And CRM ToolsÂ </li>
<li>>New API FunctionalitiesÂ </li>
<li>>Native Support For Subscription Commerce And Continuity ProgramsÂ </li>
<li>>B2B Product Configurator And Guided SellingÂ </li>

<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Order Management System (OMS) Integration with Popular Ecommerce Platforms</strong><br />In addition to previously supported integrations with Amazon, eBay, Rakuten, and Sears.com, GoECart 360â¢ now offers integration with popular e-commerce platforms such as Magento, Shopify, and BigCommerce. It also allows merchants to sync their inventory, orders, customer and fulfillment data with these e-commerce platforms while GoECartâs OMS serves as the backbone system of record for omni-channel commerce. This allows merchants to make a quick and smooth transition by simply integrating their current e-commerce solution with GoECartâs suite as opposed to a full rip and replace.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>New APIs and Features</strong><br />GoECart knows the future of Software-as-a-Service resides in API flexibility, providing merchants with the ability to combine different software tools and customize their solutions. For this reason, the latest release delivers a host of new APIs and features. The new APIs allow developers to extend the GoECart platform even further with tools and applications of their choice. Some of the new API features include Inventory updates and adjustments, Vendor Purchase Orders, CRM tasks, and activities.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Native Support for Subscription Commerce and Continuity Programs</strong><br />The enhanced GoECart 360â¢ features a new subscription module that will allow customers to subscribe to one or more products on the merchantâs website, automatically placing orders according to the schedule designated by the customer. For repeat customers, such as corporate offices that may place monthly supply orders, subscriptions present meaningful convenience.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In Chowdharyâs words, âSubscription commerce features like recurring orders and auto-ship will help our clients to simultaneously boost purchase frequency while increasing customer lifetime value (LTV) by as much as 200% to 400%. Giving shoppers the ability to subscribe to product purchases is a game changer in the realm of customer retention, and it gives our merchants the same robust subscription capabilities offered by the likes of Dollar Shave ClubÂ®, AmazonÂ® Prime, and BirchboxÂ®.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWeâve been piloting the GoECartâs Subscription and Continuity features and the results so far have been promising. Itâs easy for our customers to use and fully automated for us to manage in the back office. We expect this module to be a hit with both our customers and our staff,â said Anthony Simone, President of 11th Street Coffee and GoECart merchant.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Product Configurator and Guided Selling</strong><br />The new platform features the option of allowing shoppers to customize products and tailor them to their specific needs before buying, adding or subtracting features or building entirely custom components from scratch, depending on the option(s) offered by the merchant. This easy Product Configurator increases customer satisfaction, profit margins, and builds loyalty.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Intuitive User Interface and Increased Security</strong><br />GoECart has completely redesigned the 360â¢ back office to create an intuitive, delightful user experience, adopting meaningful icons, reorganizing the navigation menu and providing faster loading pages. Moreover, the new upgrade delivers the convenience of redirecting the admin user to the last visited page when they log in and offers the increased security merchants seek by locking the admin user accounts for 24 hours after six continuous failed login attempts. In addition, a superior forgotten password feature for merchants decreases the likelihood of hacked accounts.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Improved Customer Experience, Loyalty and CRM tools</strong><br />GoECart knows how important customer experience is and how it can help a brand to differentiate itself in todayâs competitive market. With this in mind, the platform provides merchants with new tools to create an immersive customer experience and brand loyalty. Customers now can login with their Facebook accounts and import Facebook data to custom fields when placing an order. The suite also offers Back-In-Stock notifications and instant delivery confirmation emails as soon as orders are delivered by UPS and FedEx, just as purchases made on top sites like Amazon.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">On the backend, new CRM features allow for powerful customer data tracking and analysis. The new 360â¢ offers merchants the ability to create and manage a points based loyalty program that rewards customers for purchases and social actions that can be easily redeemed towards future purchases.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Ship-From-Store and Order Fulfillment Optimization</strong><br />The new Ship-from-Store feature allows merchants to transform brick-and-mortar stores into virtual warehouses and ship orders not from a faraway distribution center but from a store located near the customer. Ship-from-Store reduces shipping costs and delivery time, integrates inventory across all stores and warehouses allowing merchants to better assess excess inventory and avoid costly markdowns, captures sales that might otherwise have been lost, and increases profit margins.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition, Order Fulfillment Optimization allows merchants to track the time spent in each step of the order fulfillment process, identify bottlenecks, opportunities for improvement and unnecessary expenditures that can be cut to reduce costs. Plus, the merchant can rate shop delivery costs from multiple carriers on a single easy to view screen and save even more in an era of free shipping expectations. These features are a nice complement to the native Point of Sale (POS) capabilities of GoECart 360â¢.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>An Unbeatable Value for Your Ecommerce Technology Investment</strong><br />The updated GoECart 360â¢ is future ready today! The platform brings all the functionalities merchants need to succeed in competitive markets, while delivering unbeatable value. It is more affordable than competing products and applications that offer far fewer native features and require pricey add-ons to complete the solution. It also eliminates the costly and time-consuming integration cycles often associated with using a patchwork of disconnected systems.</p>
