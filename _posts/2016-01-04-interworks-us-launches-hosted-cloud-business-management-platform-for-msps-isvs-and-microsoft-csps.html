<p><a href="https://www.interworks.com/">Interworks US</a>, the premier cloud business management platform provider, announced the launch of its new hosted Cloud Business Management Platform today. With Interworks Cloud Platform, Managed Services Providers (MSPs), Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), and Microsoft Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) gain a competitive edge in the marketplace by running and managing their businesses more effectively while delivering on-demand cloud services to their customers and resellers via an intuitive online marketplace.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are excited to bring the Interworks Cloud Business Management Platform to MSPs, ISVs and CSPs so they can take their business to the cloud today and start growing new recurring revenue streams while streamlining business operations. The platform automates provisioning of cloud services through a brandable storefront as well as automating core business processes such as recurring billing and subscription management,&rdquo; said Michael Callan, CEO. &ldquo;We bring over seven years of experience in the industry to this opportunity, including being recognized by MSP Mentor in the top 501 Global MSPs, and are focused on helping MSPs, ISVs and CSPs streamline and grow their business and start offering automated cloud services today.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Interworks Cloud Platform is the only platform which offers centralized management of Cloud Services and addresses the needs of Managed Service Providers, ISVs and CSPs worldwide. It combines marketing, sales, billing, provisioning and ticketing in a multi-tier platform, providing a turn-key solution for the delivery of Cloud Services. Deployed in just days instead of weeks or months, this platform centralizes and streamlines all core business functions into one online platform with a 360-degree view of the business (CRM, ticketing, billing, sales, etc.) and automates delivery of IaaS and SaaS offerings. The full featured platform also offers streamlined API integrations at each key process point allowing providers to customize the platform to suit their specific needs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The platform is recommended as a CSP-enabling solution for Microsoft 1- and 2-Tier CSPs who need to automate the provisioning of Office 365, Azure and more. Microsoft CSP&rsquo;s can create customized Office 365 bundles and unique value offerings and market them via their own custom branded online marketplace. Clients can purchase Microsoft cloud offerings from the online storefront, manage the service via Microsoft&rsquo;s administration panel and have complete control of their subscriptions and plans.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to the powerful business management features, providers can reduce Tier I support calls and empower their clients with self-service options including server reboots, password resets and 24/7 cloud services ordering and management from an online marketplace.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our Cloud Platform is for providers who are tired of trying to manage numerous systems and complicated ordering processes and who are ready to start growing their business and offering cloud services today,&rdquo; said Callan. &ldquo;What really sets us apart from other platforms is that we are obsessive about customer care and are invested in the success of our MSP, ISV and CSP partners. We provide a complete playbook for getting started and growing their cloud business and are there to help every step of the way.&rdquo;</p>
