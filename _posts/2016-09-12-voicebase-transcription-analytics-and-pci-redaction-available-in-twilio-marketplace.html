<p>Today at Twilio SIGNAL, the developer conference for communications, <a href="https://www.voicebase.com">VoiceBase, Inc.</a>, a massively scalable speech recognition and speech analytics API, announces it will be one of the initial Add-ons in the newly unveiled Twilio Marketplace. The Twilio Marketplace provides developers a catalog to discover, learn and install partner technologies, like VoiceBase, to enhance their Twilio applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Via the Twilio Marketplace, developers can now easily discover and install VoiceBase&rsquo;s high accuracy machine transcription, automatic keyword and topic extraction and PCI redaction into any application. The Marketplace allows Twilio developers the ability to add tremendous value to individual solutions by simply selecting which Add-on to invoke as part of the core Twilio API.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Developers looking to have their recordings machine transcribed to surface actionable data and automate business processes can now do so with ease,&rdquo; said Walter Bachtiger, CEO &amp; Founder, VoiceBase. &ldquo;We are excited to be an initial member of Twilio Marketplace and to showcase the combined value of our speech analytics and Twilio&rsquo;s new dual channel recording capability.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">VoiceBase will have two Add-ons in the Marketplace initially, the first being &lsquo;VoiceBase High Accuracy Transcription&rsquo; which delivers the transcript, automatically extracted keywords and automatically generated topics. The second Add-on, &lsquo;VoiceBase PCI Redaction&rsquo; will enable Payment Card Industry (PCI) data redaction as well as the basic features from the first Add-on. For developers targeting &lsquo;voice of the customer&rsquo; or &lsquo;sales optimization&rsquo; applications, it is essential that their queriable repository of spoken information be free of PCI data.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our goal is to allow developers to do more with less code,&rdquo; said Patrick Malatack, VP of Product Management at Twilio. &ldquo;With the new VoiceBase Add-ons, developers can integrate advanced speech analytics and transcription capabilities into their applications in a single-click. We&rsquo;re pleased to include VoiceBase as an initial partner for the launch of the Twilio Marketplace.&rdquo;</p>
