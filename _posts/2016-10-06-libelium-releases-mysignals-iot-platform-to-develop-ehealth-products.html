<p>Libelium releases <a href="http://my-signals.com">MySignals</a>, the most complete eHealth development platform with 15 different sensors that measure the most important body parameters (ECG, glucose, airflow, pulse, oxygen in blood, blood pressure...). All the biometric data is encrypted and sent to the Libelium Cloud in realtime to be visualized on the user's private account.</p>
<p>MySignals includes the key parameters that are usually measured in a hospital monitoring room, fits in a small suitcase and costs one hundred times lower than an Emergency Observation Unit. Developers can prototype in a deep, affordable and easy way. &ldquo;Half of the world's population lives in rural areas with very limited access to hospitals; this platform could enhance the potential of new IoT eHealth and medical applications&rdquo;, says David Gasc&oacute;n, Libelium CTO.</p>
<p>Libelium offers two different API's for developers to access the information. The Android / iOS API allows to get information directly from MySignals using Bluetooth. The API Cloud allows to access to the user's private account and get the information previously stored to be visualized in a third party platform. "Until now, there was nothing in the market like MySignals, the perfect development tool for new medical devices and applications for quick prototyping and testing eHealth products", states David Gasc&oacute;n.</p>
<p>MySignals improves the future of health services to cover one of the main challenges of the century: enhancing the universal accessibility to a healthcare system for more than 2 billion people worldwide. According to CSIRO, self health care monitoring technology could save $3 billion yearly to public health services in avoidable admissions to hospital, reduced length of stay and fewer demands on primary care.</p>
<p>For the first time ever, Libelium releases to the market an IoT solution ready for eHealth applications including a completely in-house design, from the hardware to the software for data visualization. &ldquo;This is a strategic shift of the company approaching to the whole value chain of the IoT&rdquo;, explains Alicia As&iacute;n, Libelium CEO.</p>
