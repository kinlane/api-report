<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_144914_voicebaselogo.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://solacesystems.com">Solace Systems</a> announced today that <a href="http://www.voicebase.com">VoiceBase</a>, a leading provider of speech APIs, has deployed Solace messaging technology to handle the high-volume routing of voice, video and text events through their system. The Solace infrastructure acts as an event-based orchestration backbone as VoiceBaseâs processing cluster transcribes, indexes, summarizes, redacts and conducts predictive analytics on an ever-increasing amount of audio and video for their customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">VoiceBaseâs wide range of speech analytics services are made available via a simple API integration. This enables companies that capture very large volumes of video or audio recordings â such as call centers and teleconferencing companies â to store and leverage that data. The API allows customers to experience this process on demand, without the cost or hassle of building and maintaining independent archival and processing systems.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âVoiceBase processes thousands of simultaneous data streams on a 10,000 CPU cluster, and volume is doubling every few months,â said Jeff Shukis, VP Engineering and Tech Ops. âWith Solace as the backbone of our event-based infrastructure, weâll be able to cost-effectively increase our processing capacity as needed to keep up with rapidly growing customer demand.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">VoiceBase chose Solace for the ability to route millions of messages per second while keeping their datacenter footprint small and operating expenses low even as they grow. VoiceBase initially used Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) for workflow orchestration, but found that operational challenges and growing event volumes made that approach unrealistic. They evaluated several software-based Java Message Service (JMS) alternatives, but realized that scaling JMS brokers to meet their needs would be prohibitively complicated and expensive.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âVoiceBase is part of the next generation of demanding enterprise cloud-based services, and weâre excited that theyâve built their innovative platform on our solution,â said Craig Betts, CEO of Solace Systems. âWe look forward to working with VoiceBase as they grow their business and offer increasingly sophisticated speech analytics services.â</p>
