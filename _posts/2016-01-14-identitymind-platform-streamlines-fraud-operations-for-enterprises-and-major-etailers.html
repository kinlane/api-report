<p><a href="http://www.identitymindglobal.com">IdentityMind Global</a>, the pioneer in Trusted Digital Identities, announced today the release of version 1.21 of its flagship Fraud Prevention and Risk Management platform. The latest version of the platform targets the operational needs of large Internet retailers, with features built for broad and intensive manual review processes.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The latest version applies lessons learned from extensive use of the platform by IdentityMind&rsquo;s enterprise clients. In practice, teams of over 400 fraud analysts found the platform&rsquo;s patent pending Electronic DNA (eDNA&trade;) technology and Trusted Digital Identities Database reduced decision time per transaction by more than 30%.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Close to 46% of flagged transactions [by automated systems] are sent for manual review&hellip; Manual reviews are not just time consuming but also expensive: merchants allocate as much as one-fourth of costs dedicated to fraud prevention to manual reviews.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">IdentityMind&rsquo;s platform combines automated decision processes, verification technology, and operational workflows to streamline the intensive manual operations required by enterprise retailers and institutions, where considerable numbers of transactions must be decided quickly. The platform complements its patent-pending eDNA&trade; and patent-pending Automated Review Policy with the operational tools risk managers and analysts require to quickly and effectively approve or deny transactions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our technology efforts are focused on building a trusted source for Internet Identities, and automating the decision process for transactions. However, there are still large areas where manual review is necessary,&rdquo; said Garrett Gafke, IdentityMind&rsquo;s President and CEO. &ldquo;Our core technology helps the risk teams in these large scale enterprises greatly reduce those manual review processes. Believing an enterprise can operate without the expertise of their risk team is unrealistic. The key is making those teams more effective, and maximizing their ability to quickly distinguish the difficult cases that really require attention. In this release, we have built a framework in which Managers can establish and report on the operational metrics of their team, easily allocate resources as they see fit, and react in real-time if necessary. Meanwhile, analysts have a well-organized interface that displays the most relevant information to quickly review and decide transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Version 1.21 of the IdentityMind Global platform includes the following major features:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">

<ul class="releaseul">

</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Account Managers can assign custom roles to their users, granting and/or prohibiting access to specific parts of the platform as needed.</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Operational Views</li>
</ul>
