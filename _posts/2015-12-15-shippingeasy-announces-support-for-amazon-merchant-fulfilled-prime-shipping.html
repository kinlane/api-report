<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;ShippingEasy was built to consolidate all of an eCommerce merchant&rsquo;s selling channels and carriers into a single system with powerful shipping tools. Amazon sellers require a robust solution that appreciates and complies with that platform&rsquo;s set guidelines. The new Amazon Buy Shipping API integration ensures compliant Amazon Prime order fulfillment within ShippingEasy.

<p class="responsiveNews">ShippingEasy long-time Amazon customers are delighted with the integration due to the convenience of shipping all orders from a single system, plus time savings of 50%.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Amazon is one of our largest sales channels and thanks to ShippingEasy helping us fulfill and ship our orders on time and accurately we have the pleasure of being part of the Amazon Merchant Fulfilled Prime (MFP) program.  However, the processing requirements are different than before and shipping was required to be purchased through Amazon.  We reached out to ShippingEasy and they developed MFP support so all shipping can be done in one place versus having to process some shipments in Amazon and the rest in ShippingEasy. MFP fulfillment through Amazon took us about 6 hours on average.  Now that ShippingEasy has integrated with the MFP program we fulfill these prime orders in 3 hours or less,&rdquo; said Jacob Baum of Fastener Source Inc.</p>
