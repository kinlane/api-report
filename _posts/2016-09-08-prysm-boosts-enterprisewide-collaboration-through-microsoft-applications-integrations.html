<p class="responsiveNews">Using the OneDrive for Business API from Microsoft, Prysm has made it easy for customers to connect Prysm to their existing OneDrive for Business environments to make it a seamless experience for end users to access, search for, and sync with content from OneDrive for Business. Within a Prysm Visual Workplace project, users may now access, work within and download content from Office 365 using Prysmâs built-in web capabilities.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">These new integrations are in addition to the previously announced Microsoft Skype for Business integration, built using the Microsoft Software Developer Kit (SDK), which created an exceptional user experience for Skype users on large display walls, a first in the industry. The Skype for Business integration from Prysm enables users to schedule or join an already scheduled Skype meeting from the Prysm Visual Workplace platform, allowing remote participants to fully engage in meetings with the ability to access and interact with all of the content loaded into the workplace.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Prysm Visual Workplace offers a unique and innovative environment enabling its users to access all of their content and data at the same time; while many traditional systems allow you to only bring up one piece of content for review at a time, when in a group setting. Working with unlimited amounts of data and file formats in a single space, users can interact and collaborate from any location or device, spurring innovation both in-office and among remote participants.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With Prysm Visual Workplace, applications, content, video conferencing and the Web are all combined into a visual workplace where teams can create, edit and share. These interactive workplaces are stored in the cloud and accessible from any device so that everyone can contribute â whether they are in the meeting room, or on the road. As enterprises are constantly looking to maximize technology investments, through this integration Prysm users are able to leverage their current Microsoft portfolios within the Prysm Visual Workplace to expand their collaboration capabilities. The Microsoft applications are added as a content layer to enable a seamless experience from the desktop where content is created to the meeting room where it is reviewed and edited by groups.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">As data and content are shared throughout the enterprise, security is a key priority in the Prysm Visual Workplace. Specifically, Prysm Cloud is built on top of Microsoft Azure, an open, flexible and enterprise-grade cloud computing platform. Azure meets a broad set of international and industry-specific compliance standards, such as ISO 27001, HIPAA, FedRAMP, SOC 1 and SOC 2, as well as country-specific standards like Australia IRAP, UK G-Cloud and Singapore MTCS. The Azure platform is deployed by 85 percent of the Fortune 500.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe want to make collaboration as easy as possible for our customers and will go above and beyond to make sure they have every application that enables them to seamlessly collaborate with colleagues, customers and partners, no matter their location or device,â said Paige OâNeill, CMO, Prysm. âContent aside, data security is one of our top priorities. As Microsoft is synonymous with enterprise applications, cloud computing and security, our work with Microsoft is incredibly important. With this integration, enterprises are not only able to leverage their existing Microsoft investments but remain confident that their shared data is safe and secure.â</p>
