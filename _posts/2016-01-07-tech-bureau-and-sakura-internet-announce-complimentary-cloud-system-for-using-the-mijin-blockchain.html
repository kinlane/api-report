<p>Tech Bureau and Sakura Internet, one of the leading Japanese cloud service provider, are working to provide Mijin CloudChain on the Sakura cloud for free, as a beta service.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Recently, fintech (*1) has been a field attracting much interest. Private and permissioned blockchains (*2) have the potential to transform fintech companies by reducing costs and increasing security. Mijin provides usable private blockchain technology that can be used via a simple JSON API.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Applications will be accepted from today, and from January 2016, registered users will be given Mijin CloudChain on the Sakura cloud, in order of registration. From financial institutions to individual developers, anyone can apply.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>+ Introducing Geographically Distributed, Zero-Downtime Blockchains to the World for Free</strong></p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sakura will provide 2 cloud servers each in both Tokyo and Ishikari, which are two places that are separated far from each other. This will allow Mijin CloudChain to be set up on 4 complimentary cloud servers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Using blockchains, point services, banking services, digital money, and many other uses can be realized at low cost. Private blockchain technology Mijin can be used in real applications without any downtime and with increased security. Through Sakura&rsquo;s cloud service, the Mijin system can be tested at no cost.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>+ Complimentary Use Until the End of June, 2016</strong></p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Tech Bureau is offering a testing licensing for Mijin CloudChain during the test period. Within the testing period anyone can create services and applications for personal or corporate use, including for paid products. Transactions processed per second will be limited, but besides that the service is the same as the Mijin service that will be introduced later in 2016. Special services for financial institutions will also be available.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">It is planned that after this complimentary trial service ends on June 30, 2016, that services will be offered to allow people to roll-over and continue using Mijin. Support for developers will be offered on Mijin&rsquo;s web site and forums.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">*1 Fintech is the merging of finance and technology. By creating new IT infrastructure that targets financial institutions, revolutionary new services and products can be created. It is because of this that in recent years VCs and other investors have been focusing on fintech companies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">*2 Blockchains are the innovation for achieving consensus on decentralized, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks, that were first proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto for use in Bitcoin. Data are cryptographically signed and thus cannot be changed or deleted. Using P2P networks allows blockchains to run with zero downtime, due to the lack of a need for a central authority. Blockchains can reduce costs dramatically because further backups are not necessary and if capacity is overloaded, the systems will continue to run. Financial institutions, in particular, are investing significant resources in studying blockchain technology.</p>
