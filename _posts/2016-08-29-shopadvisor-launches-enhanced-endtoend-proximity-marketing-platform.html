<p><a href="http://www.shopadvisor.com/1/">ShopAdvisor</a>, the leader in drive-to-store retail proximity marketing, has delivered a major enhancement to its platform. Leveraging the company&rsquo;s acquisition of Retailigence earlier this year, the new version features across-the-board enhancements to its Product Intelligence, Context Intelligence and Shopper Intelligence modules. ShopAdvisor has also introduced new advancements to its appNET and its Retail Partner Program, which extend the scope and value of the ShopAdvisor ecosystem for all participants -- consumers, media/publishers, brands, retailers, agencies, and mall operators. The new version of the ShopAdvisor Platform enables quick and cost-effective development and execution of proximity marketing campaigns, which deliver personalized and compelling shopping experiences that take shoppers from their smartphones into stores to purchase products.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Proximity marketing has developed to a point where location awareness and basic shopper information has become a commodity,&rdquo; said Jeff Papows, CEO ShopAdvisor. &ldquo;Our customers are excited about the new version of our platform because it provides them with vastly deeper intelligence about shopper affinities that are contextually relevant based on shopper activity from our appNET partners and near real-time details on millions of products across hundreds of thousands retail locations. This means that when their 'Powered by ShopAdvisor' campaigns drive consumers to stores, it will be done with incredible personalization and the knowledge that the specific product a customer wants will be there. To date, this has been something the vast majority of proximity marketing campaigns have failed to deliver, but the success our customers are seeing indicates that we&rsquo;ve solved this problem.&rdquo;</p>
