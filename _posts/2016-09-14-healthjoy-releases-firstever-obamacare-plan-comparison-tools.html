<p><a href="https://healthjoy.com">HealthJoy</a> has released the first publicly available tools that analyze Obamacare health insurance plans and compare the size of provider networks and prescription coverage. Due to recent federal requirements, insurance companies were required to supply all plan information in a standardized data format (MRF). Despite being available to the public for over 15 months, this data has gone largely unused by individuals and researchers because of inconsistent formatting and the lack of easy-to-use tools.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Over the past six months and with cooperation from a large number of insurance companies, HealthJoy has significantly improved the accuracy of the available data. The company is now releasing these tools for use by the public.</p>
