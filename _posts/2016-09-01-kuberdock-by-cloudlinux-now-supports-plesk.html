<p class="responsiveNews">âKuberDock platform has been designed to work with various control panels and billing systems through an extensive API that ships with the product, but for the most popular platforms we want to provide an out-of-the-box integration,â said Igor Seletskiy, CloudLinux CEO. âAt initial launch, we delivered features for easy integration with cPanel and WHMCS, but now weâve added support for Plesk. DirectAmin support will be available very soon, in September 2016.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">KuberDock is a revolutionary platform which allows hosters to expand their application hosting portfolio by offering access to 70K+ of apps, such as MongoDB and ElasticSearch, available in docker hub. KuberDock is now actively tested and used in more than 20 countries - from the USA and Latin America to Europe and Asia and is becoming a key offering by the maker of the best performance and security products for hosters.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Besides Plesk integration, there are a lot of new improvements in KuberDock version 1.3 that are useful for the hosting providers and their customers. The hosters will appreciate the possibility to backup and restore KuberDock master server, which makes the service more reliable. They also received a new ability to assign static IPs to users` pods. When KuberDock cluster uses static IPs for public access to customers applications this allows to assign specific IPs to a specific node in the cluster.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">As for the end users, they have been provided with the anticipated feature that allows accessing their containers securely using SSH, SCP or SFTP. The connections are managed at per-container level. SSH and SFTP credentials are saved until a customer regenerates them by himself.</p>
