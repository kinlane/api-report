Previously named a Gartner Cool Vendor in Unified Communications and now serving thousands of customers, OnSIP is the first cloud phone system and UC provider to integrate with Slack.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Available in the Slack App Directory, OnSIPâs Slack app enables customers to generate voice and video call links with a slash command and share in Slack channels, email signatures, social media, and web pages. OnSIP call links are permanent links that can be used to initiate free, high definition, encrypted voice and video calls to any OnSIP phone or application (e.g. a conference suite, announcement, or call queue). The Slack app also provides slash commands for support and checking OnSIPâs network status.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âLevel Agency uses Slack as our primary source of internal office communication,â said Stephen Shunk, IT Specialist at Level Agency, an OnSIP customer. âLooking into OnSIP, I instantly was attracted to its easy-to-use interface. One of my favorite OnSIP features is the ability to have a desk phone, web app, and smartphone app open at the same time â and have OnSIP ring me wherever I am at any given moment during the working day. Integrating Slack with the OnSIP app has helped productivity by giving us a single window where we can address all our communication both in and out of our office. Our world of digital advertising moves quickly, and itâs important to have communication tools that help us be more agile and efficient.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to the app in the Slack App Directory, OnSIP has integrated Slack messaging in their browser interface, the OnSIP app. The OnSIP app is a web phone with presence, click-to-call, voice and video chat, voicemail management, drag-and-drop transfer, queue monitoring, and more.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âIntegrating with Slack was a natural choice,â said John Riordan, Cofounder and CTO of OnSIP. âWeâre focused on moving business calls to the web for better user experiences and call data. For messaging, we integrated with Slack because we believe modern teams prefer complementary best-of-breed applications with easy setup over one-stop platforms with average performance and heavy commitments. Both OnSIP and Slack offer freemium service, allowing organizations to explore the services at their pace.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This announcement closely follows OnSIPâs Free Plan launch for both businesses and developers. The company is the first to offer a free UCaaS solution that extends beyond collaboration, connecting organizations to their customers and other stakeholders. Customers using OnSIPâs Free Plan can take advantage of the Slack integration. For more information on OnSIPâs freemium service, listen to the industry analyst Peter Radizeski interview John Riordan on TMC.net or read the original announcement here.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">OnSIPâs ability to deliver integrated web-based calling with Slack is in part thanks to an open source project called WebRTC, which enables real-time voice, video, messaging, and data in the browser without plugins or add-ons. OnSIP has been named a WebRTC Pioneer by TMC.net and continues to further this technology with their open source library for JavaScript developers, SIP.js.
