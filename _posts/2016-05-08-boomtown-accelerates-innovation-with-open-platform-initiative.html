<p><a href="http://www.boomtownroi.com">BoomTown</a>, a leading real estate sales and marketing technology provider, has launched an Open Platform Initiative, which will pave the way for an expanded developer ecosystem and strengthen its solutions and services. With new partnerships and integrations, and an expanding product offering and leadership team, BoomTown is poised for further growth on all fronts.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Modern real estate teams and brokerages need a partner that truly understands the challenges and opportunities that the industry currently faces and anticipates what&rsquo;s coming tomorrow,&rdquo; said Grier Allen, BoomTown&rsquo;s President &amp; CEO. "BoomTown is focused on the future of real estate and driving innovation in the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Expanding platform and solutions suite <br />Through key integrations and the upcoming release of its Application Program Interface (API), BoomTown is dedicated to building an open environment that will spur rapid innovation on its platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The company will expand its partner network even more later this year through the upcoming release of its API, which is a core part of its strategy to become an open platform. In addition to its partner integrations, the first large scale initiative for the API will be an agent-facing mobile application, currently in development. &ldquo;Modern real estate agents want all their tools in one system,&rdquo; said Allen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve listened and are building best of breed integrations and opening our platform to drive efficiency and better results.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In line with its mission, BoomTown has ramped up integration efforts, recently releasing an integration with BombBomb, a leading provider of video email marketing solutions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;In a digital environment, personalization and breakthrough marketing are critical to ensuring customers feel connected to an agent,&rdquo; said Kristen Fergason, BoomTown&rsquo;s vice president of marketing. &ldquo;Partnering with BombBomb was a natural fit for us as the integration enables agents to build meaningful relationships with their prospects and customers&mdash;from a centralized platform and right from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We've known the BoomTown team for years and have many mutual customers who are equally excited about and are already using this integration with great results," said Conor McCluskey, BombBomb&rsquo;s CEO and co-founder. "BombBomb will help get BoomTown customers face to face with their prospects and clients more often, which will drive engagement and translate to more leads and closed deals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This adds to its roster of integration partners including the popular Mojo Dialer, maximizing real estate agents&rsquo; telephone prospecting efficiency, Realtors Property Resource (RPR), which provides seamless access to data on more than 166 million parcels of property in the United States and Bandwidth, powering BoomTown&rsquo;s integrated texting feature. When paired with its predictive Customer Relationship Management (CRM) tools, these key integrations enable smart prospecting in less time.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In the past year, the company has also expanded its suite of solutions, now ranging from its most popular and best-in-class offering for midsize teams and brokerages, to an expansion product for multi-office power users, and a streamlined offering for small teams, currently in pilot with general availability in the coming months.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;With BoomTown, I&rsquo;m confident that I have a technology partner that is committed to my team&rsquo;s continued success and growth,&rdquo; said Ben Kinney, Keller Williams mega agent, long-time BoomTown customer, entrepreneur, speaker and author. &ldquo;BoomTown is focused on innovation and delivering the tools we need to get closer to our customers.&rdquo;</p>
