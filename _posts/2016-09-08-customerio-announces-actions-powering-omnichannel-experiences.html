<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_61405_customer.io_logo.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://customer.io/">Customer.io</a>, a behavioral messaging platform for automating hyper-personalized customer communication, today announced Customer.io Actions, extending the platformâs rich behavior-based segmentation and automation to other tools in the marketing stack. In response to strong demand from customers, Actions paves the way for marketers to leverage real-time behavioral data to create rich multi-channel experiences throughout the customer journey.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to a recent survey of global marketing leaders by CMO, only 4 percent of respondents said they are powering customer interactions in every channel with real-time, personalized experiences. Until now, there hasnât been an easy way to access and manage that data in marketing automation and customer engagement tools. Actions enables marketers to connect to other applications and tools in the marketing stack, leveraging Customer.ioâs rich behavioral data and rules engine to control when additional customer touchpoints are sent.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Using data to create meaningful and relevant experiences for customers is critical for our business,â said Nick Macario, CEO at Branded.me.Â âCustomer.ioâs segmentation and automation engine has changed the way we communicate with customers, and we're excited that Actions will give us the ability to takeÂ that even further and leverage that same level of data-driven personalization with other communication channels.âÂ </p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Powerful Automation Platform Used to Trigger Targeted Emails, Now Connecting to New Channels and Tools</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With Actions, marketing teams can connect to any tool with a RESTful API - from CRM systems to mobile, SMS and push-notification apps, to team chat tools, data automation tools, bug tracking and other business apps via webhooks. For example,</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>send an SMS message via Twilio (e.g., send a confirmation text after a user books a service appointment)</li>
<li>send a push notification via Urban Airship (e.g., send a reminder message via push triggered by an abandoned cart)</li>
<li>push a message into Slack (e.g., notify your team when users reach milestones or indicate that they might churn so they can follow up)</li>
<li>send a postcard via Lob (e.g., send a thank you postcard for high-value accounts)</li>
<li>add a lead into Close.io (e.g., automate lead entries into your CRM upon every app signup, or control when you add leads)</li>
<li>send data into the 500+ apps through Zapier webhooks (e.g., add data to a spreadsheet, post data to Facebook, send data into Hubspot forms, add registrants to GoToWebinar and so much more)</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to Actions, Customer.io has also updated its powerful campaign automation tool for enhancing user experience, making it even easier to create omni-channel campaigns on the fly, without laboring away with heavy tools or in-house development.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe want our clients to spend more time creating lasting relationships with theirÂ customers and growing their businessâand less time setting up and managing their messagingÂ infrastructure,â said Colin Nederkoorn, CEO of Customer.io. âActions furthers our long-term vision of making it easy for growth marketers to use behavioral data to create rich experiences for their audiences, something that until now has been difficult for marketers to do.â</p>

To help clients get started, Customer.io has created several suggested Actions including Zapier, Twilio, Slack, Urban Airship and others.
