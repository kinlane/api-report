<p><a href="http://accuratebackground.com/">Accurate Background</a>, the fastest growing and most trusted provider of employment background screening, today announced the introduction of an API integration with iCIMS, Inc., a leading provider of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) talent acquisition solutions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Accurate Background, specializing in employment background screening and drug testing services, now offers an improved integration with the iCIMS Talent Platform, a suite of talent acquisition tools that enables organizations to attract, screen, and hire the best talent for their ever-changing business needs. The upgraded integration enriches the customer experience by offering a seamless transfer of candidate background screening data from the Accurate Background platform into the iCIMS Talent Platform, where recruiters can manage the hiring process from start to finish, all within a single, cloud-based application.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our API integration allows the instant availability of Accurate Background&rsquo;s solutions within the iCIMS Talent Platform,&rdquo; said Scott Hebert, chief revenue officer at Accurate Background. &ldquo;This addition strengthens our already excellent partnership with iCIMS and furthers our dedication to providing reliable background screening services to our family of mutual clients and prospects.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;As over half of the information presented on a resume may be false or misleading, companies must thoroughly investigate a candidate&rsquo;s background before extending an employment offer to help minimize potential risk,&rdquo; said Michael Wilczak, senior vice president, strategy and corporate development of iCIMS. &ldquo;Through our enhanced integration with Accurate Background, we look to improve our customers&rsquo; background screening experience to enable them to make more informed hiring decisions.&rdquo;</p>
