<p><a href="http://www.qqsolutions.com">QQSolutions</a>, a leading provider of agency management systems for thousands of independent insurance agencies, today announced record growth of the company&rsquo;s flagship agency management solution, QQCatalyst&reg;. Almost a year after joining the Vertafore&reg; portfolio, QQCatalyst has achieved a 55 percent year-over-year increase in customers and almost doubled revenue. In tandem with this announcement, QQSolutions is also releasing details on a new QQCatalyst integration that will offer personal lines ratings and quotes embedded directly within the platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The recent success of QQCatalyst follows a year of unprecedented product innovation and new features specifically designed to help independent agents be flexible and efficient to compete in an evolving market. As technology budgets remain largely stagnant for independent agents, with 60 percent reporting no budget increases in 2015 (Aite Group), providing cost-effective, intuitive solutions are particularly critical to stay competitive. Jason Cass, owner of The Insurance Alliance, has successfully leveraged QQCatalyst to improve productivity while differentiating from the competition.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;QQCatalyst is so good in so many ways. To the customer experience needed you will have to prospect, sell, service, and cross-sell to many types of people in our society all with different needs,&rdquo; said Cass. &ldquo;Being able to use API technology freely allows me to be niche, versatile, and different than any other agency. That gives me a competitive advantage and the client service that my customers need.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Additionally, the new QQCatalyst rating integration will connect rating information across the agency management system, eliminating the need to open a new program or enter data twice. This latest enhancement is designed to streamline use of the comparative rater solution which, according to McKinsey, is a critical selling tool for agents who need to compile, compare, and present a range of quotes from the office or on the go. Powered by FSC Rater&reg; and PL Rating, the integration will be available nationwide this summer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our customers provide us with a clear line of sight into what is essential for the success of their business, which has translated to a year of product innovation and improvements built on providing real value through intuitive solutions,&rdquo; said Mark Malis, president of QQSolutions. &ldquo;Our recent success is owed to the thousands of agile agents that we work with on a daily basis, and we look forward to continuing our growth trajectory alongside them in the coming year.&rdquo;</p>
