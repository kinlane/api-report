<p><a href="https://www.sookasa.com/box-request/">Cloud security company Sookasa</a> today announced a native integration with enterprise file sync-and-share platform Box. As part of the integration, Sookasa also launched Box Audit, which analyzes user activity on the Box platform to help administrators mitigate security risks.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sookasa, an API-based Cloud Access Security Broker, simplifies SaaS security with a holistic suite of security products that detect potential data breach risks, protect important information, and enforce security policies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to debut our integration with Box,&rdquo; said Asaf Cidon, CEO and co-founder of Sookasa. &ldquo;As more and more businesses turn to Box to replace their content management systems, we're happy to be able to provide the visibility enterprises need to do their work most effectively and securely.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Box is a leading enterprise file sync-and-share platform, with 41 million registered users across 54,000 business customers, many of them in regulated industries. A number of Box&rsquo;s largest deals have been sparked by consolidation projects. Sookasa is taking a similar approach by enabling enterprises to centralize security needs across SaaS solutions on one CASB platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sookasa&rsquo;s integration with Box also follows in the footsteps of its partnerships with other successful enterprise sync-and-share solutions like Dropbox and Google Drive. Like those platforms, Box provides enterprise-grade security for content at rest on its servers&mdash;but on all these platforms, these protections disappear when files are shared, synced, or stored on devices, leaving the files vulnerable to data breaches. Gaining visibility into how users are sharing files in Box is a key step to extending protection beyond the platform and making sure users are syncing and storing files safely.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By leveraging Box&rsquo;s API, Sookasa&rsquo;s Box Audit enables team administrators to monitor real-time activity across team accounts, audit what files are being shared within Box and when, assess data usage analytics, and detect and protect sensitive data stored on the cloud.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Enhancing Box&rsquo;s security with our Audit solution enables enterprises to get the most out of the Box platform,&rdquo; Cidon said. &ldquo;Box is well known for its enterprise-grade security features, and our solutions are designed to provide greater visibility against threats across SaaS solutions, even when data is moved out of the Box platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Box Audit pairs seamlessly with Sookasa&rsquo;s encryption products to drive advanced remediation of risks. Sookasa also plans to roll out encryption for Box in the coming months, which would keep files shared within Box secure even when synced to mobile devices.</p>
