The Power BI platform enables business users to directly connect, analyze and gain insights from their business data through a broad selection of easy-to-use dashboards, interactive reports and compelling visualizations. The Power BI realtime streaming data capabilities currently in preview mode, and is free to trial.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">While most businesses understand that they would benefit from realtime data visualization, solutions are difficult to build, fragile, and inflexible. Many leading companies still end up waiting for IT teams to run static reports to tell them what went wrong yesterday instead of monitoring a constant flow of data and making decisions and adjustments in realtime.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With the interoperation of the PubNub Data Stream Network to the Power BI platform, users can easily pass streaming data from sensors, logging systems, and more directly into Power BI, enabling them to make better decisions based on actionable realtime data.</p>

With software development kits (SDKs) for over 70 platforms and languages, PubNub also offers unmatched flexibility to businesses looking to integrate realtime data from a wide variety of mobile, browser, server, and embedded environments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âPower BI is a leading solution for enterprise data visualization, so we are very excited to collaborate with the Power BI team to incorporate realtime data into every business,â said Todd Greene, CEO of PubNub. âOur ability to stream massive amounts of realtime data with low latency and unmatched reliability will allow Power BI to enhance their promise of fast, efficient and actionable data visualization.â</p>
