Businesses can utilize advanced API tools to facilitate collaboration within their DevOps teams when they publish data and applications in the cloud or deploy mobile and IoT applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOur new version of Restlet Studio reflects demand from businesses for an integrated platform for the design, testing, and delivery of APIs, a process that streamlines workflows of development, QA and production teams,â said Jerome Louvel, founder and Chief Geek of Restlet. âRestlet is dedicated to providing the best API DevOps platform with the strongest ecosystem. We welcome cooperation from other vendors.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Restlet Platform for APIs is used by more than 2 million developers. Closer integration with other DevOps vendors is planned.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new version of Restlet Studio also adds support for nested data structures. This allows developers to design the most advanced API definitions, making the API easier to organize and more scalable. To allow large APIs to be redesigned or enable major changes after a team review, the API elements can now be reordered with drag and drop. Resources, representations and operations are easily organized with simple point-and-click actions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Other new features</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>New search feature inside of Restlet Studio</li>
<li>New keyboard shortcuts such as CTRL-S (Windows) or CMD-S (Mac)</li>
<li>Redesigned navigation panel for API-at-a-glance</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Restlet Studio is the leading cloud-based API design tool that supports all major API specification languages such as OpenAPI (fka Swagger) and RAML specifications. Restlet Studio relieves developers of the complexity of API definition languages by providing a visual designer that helps them share APIs with their entire DevOps team.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Restlet Studio is freely available as a cloud application. Professional versions of the Restlet Platform start at $9/month. Plans that support team collaboration and continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) start at $49/month.</p>
