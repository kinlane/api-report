<p><a href="http://SoundHound.com">SoundHound Inc.</a>, the leading innovator in sound recognition and voice search technologies, today announced new partnerships for Houndify, its voice-enabling developer platform, furthering the company&rsquo;s mission to &ldquo;Houndify everything.&rdquo; Data from Uber and Yelp will now be accessible by developers using the Houndify platform, to provide users with the information and actions they want.</p>
<p>Houndify launched in December, after a decade of research and development, and enables developers to revolutionize their products and services by adding voice-enabled conversational intelligence to any app or product. Houndify is already featured in SoundHound Inc.&rsquo;s mobile apps, Hound and SoundHound<span class="bwuline">,</span> making them hands-free and voice interface enabled. In addition, more than 15,000 partners have registered to use the Houndify platform for their products, including NVIDIA, Samsung and more. Houndify provides software development kits (SDKs) across all major operating systems and platforms, including iOS, Android, Windows, Unix, and Raspberry Pi, giving unparalleled speed-to-market and the ability to scale, and includes an ever-expanding set of domains, which are programs that provide users with relevant information or actions related to their queries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled to include partners like Uber and Yelp in our Houndify platform, which gives developers unprecedented abilities to add a natural, conversational voice interface to anything,&rdquo; said Keyvan Mohajer, co-founder/CEO of SoundHound Inc. &ldquo;Now Houndify developers have the tools to create experiences that enable voice interfaces for finding the best restaurant and booking an Uber to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Uber domain is now accessible for all developers using Houndify, and enables them to access Uber data and initiate booking. This enables developers to incorporate Uber ride requests into their own product experiences, as seen in the Hound app, including asking fare and distance information, hands-free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I'm a huge believer in voice interfaces, so it's exciting to have Uber capabilities baked into the Houndify platform. I can&rsquo;t wait to see how developers use this in their apps&rdquo; said Chris Saad, Head of Product, Uber Developer Platform.</p>
<p>Yelp announced the Houndify partnership as part of its new Yelp Fusion developer program, which includes more tools for developers to build with the new Yelp Fusion API and Yelp data, plus a revamped developer portal. With the Yelp domain now live and publicly accessible within the Houndify platform, developers can easily access Yelp data and create rich voice-enabled experiences for local search.</p>
<p>"We're excited to expand our partnership with SoundHound and bring Houndify on as a Yelp Fusion developer partner," Chad Richard, SVP Business &amp; Corporate Development, Yelp. "By integrating the Yelp Fusion API into Houndify, developers can not only build amazing conversational interfaces into their products, but they'll also have the best local data available. This partnership helps us further Yelp's mission of making local content and data accessible to consumers in more places and encouraging innovation in the developer world."</p>
