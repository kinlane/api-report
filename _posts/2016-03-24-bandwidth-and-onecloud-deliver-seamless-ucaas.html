<p><a href="http://onecloudnetworks.com/">OneCloud Networks (OCN)</a> offers a variety of cloud-based communications services to companies nationwide. When they needed a provider with services and flexibility that complemented their cloud portfolio, they turned to Bandwidth&rsquo;s communications APIs to provide reliable voice and emergency services through a unique per-seat delivery model.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">OCN was looking for a provider that seamlessly integrated with BroadCloud, as one of the first MSPs to implement BroadSoft&rsquo;s BroadCloud premier unified communications as-a-service platform (UCaaS). Certified on BroadCloud in 2015, Bandwidth&rsquo;s APIs provide OCN an easy way to streamline the customer onboarding process and lower operational hurdles. Integrating directly with OCN&rsquo;s UCaaS services, Bandwidth&rsquo;s software provides a low barrier for entry by making it simple to order, activate and port phone numbers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The BroadCloud integration is the latest chapter in OCN&rsquo;s work with Bandwidth, deploying Bandwidth&rsquo;s communications APIs for number provisioning and emergency services for over two years. By streamlining communications services and support with providers such as Bandwidth, OCN&rsquo;s customer churn rate is less than one percent. They&rsquo;re also looking to leverage Bandwidth&rsquo;s simple and frictionless per-seat model to competitively position future UCaaS offerings.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;When Bandwidth and BroadCloud are working together, the services are integrated and ready to deploy,&rdquo; said Haider Mirjat, Chief Solutions Officer, OneCloud Networks. &ldquo;Bandwidth provides the APIs and flexibility of a contemporary, software-driven carrier that&rsquo;s not stodgy and old. They offer the value needed to reduce our expenses, with an immediate comfort level to deploy nationwide services right away, making us both competitive and reliable at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve built a successful SIP Voice Services business by helping service providers utilize the best technology through a model that can help them grow,&rdquo; said Todd Hagstrom, senior director of Product Management, Bandwidth. &ldquo;OCN realized early on that the future of communications was in the cloud, using our API integrations to improve their time to market customer satisfaction, while reducing expenses. We&rsquo;ve modeled our service offerings for other providers to leverage this simple, fixed cost model to rapidly grow their communications businesses.&rdquo;</p>
