<p><a href="http://www.tempuspayment.com">Tempus Technologies, Inc</a>., a leading expert for secure payments at the point of interaction, today announced a new partnership with Ingenico Group, the global leader in seamless payment.  Tempus Technologies will combine its semi-integrated payments solution PaymentMate&reg;, with Ingenico Group&rsquo;s Telium smart terminals to offer a streamlined approach for businesses requiring superior payment security and simplified EMV software integration.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">PaymentMate is a SaaS solution encompassing true end-to-end encryption (E2EE) and tokenization. Encryption and tokenization enables sensitive payment data to be replaced with a unique identifier, which in turn removes the need to decrypt and then re-encrypt data for authentication. With the PaymentMate software embedded into the Telium terminal, the possibility of card data entering the merchant&rsquo;s point of sale (POS) device is eliminated.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Ingenico Group offers the world&rsquo;s most advanced and secure payment technologies. With the demand and growth of Ingenico Group&rsquo;s smart terminals and the advancement for semi-integrated technology, we made the right choice in partnering with Ingenico,&rdquo; commented Brian Merena, Executive Vice President with Tempus Technologies. &ldquo;Our combined solutions generate higher lifetime value for customers because they benefit from a broader selection of custom data security competencies. Developers can also create custom apps using PaymentMate&rsquo;s API, resulting in cost reductions associated with PCI DSS scope requirements, and adoption for EMV compliances,&rdquo; stated Merena.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Semi-integrated environments are becoming increasingly popular with merchants that are looking for a way to help streamline the EMV migration process, increase protection of sensitive card data, and reduce their PCI audit scope,&rdquo; said Howard Finch, Vice President of Sales, North America at Ingenico Group. &ldquo;Together, Tempus Technologies and Ingenico Group can help simplify EMV implementations and PCI compliance, while saving merchants valuable time and money.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Tempus Technologies has completed its U.S. EMV certifications with all the major card brands (Visa&reg;, MasterCard&reg;, American Express&reg; and Discover&reg;). The company has extensive experience with multi-level locations and complex cash management requirements for all business sizes, and is well positioned to deliver high quality and secure payments for all types of transaction environments across North America.</p>
