The OneCampus solution, a cloud-based platform, was chosen by St. Edwardâs to replace the current platform for their university portal, myHilltop, over the course of the next year.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">OneCampus is a service discovery portal that simplifies access to campus services such as grades, class schedules, campus activities, email, and much more. OneCampus connects to St. Edwardâs Universityâs campus-based authentication system to allow for single sign-on (SSO) to institutional services and applications. With a robust Google-like search engine, and ratings and reviews to effectively analyze what services are being used, OneCampus provides a modern approach to organizing web-based services. OneCampus also has powerful APIs to push data from popular systems used on campus, like Canvas.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">St. Edwardâs University selected OneCampus because of its marked improvements in user experience for its campus community. The university has long looked for ways to make vital campus information easier to find and use, from wherever students, faculty, and staff might be, and OneCampus is an integral step in making university services more user-focused.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOneCampus provides an intuitive, mobile-ready gateway to the information our campus community needs most, which is something weâve heard from students, staff and faculty when showing them the platform. As weâve begun building our site, our staff has taken to calling OneCampus the âfast trackâ to information, and weâre eager for our entire campus to enjoy the benefits of its clean, user-centric design,â said David Waldron, Vice President for Information Technology at St. Edwardâs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The OneCampus community includes nearly a million students, parents and faculty from colleges and universities across the country, and plays an integral part in helping students find success on campus. OneCampus delivers the digital experience students expect, with the ease and efficiency schools such as St. Edwardâs University need.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe are excited to welcome St. Edwardâs University to the OneCampus community,â said rSmart CEO Tony Potts. âWith a global perspective and a focus on an international campus environment, St. Edwardâs is an ideal institution to give students and faculty the most current solution for navigating campus services from any location.â</p>
