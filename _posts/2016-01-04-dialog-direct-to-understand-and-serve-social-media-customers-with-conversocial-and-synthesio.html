<p class="responsiveNews">Dialog Direct is a marketing and customer engagement specialist that helps businesses to generate leads, increase sales and provide superior customer engagement solutions based on remarkable experiences.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Conversocial and Synthesio partnered in May of 2015 with the agreement of a technical integration to combine the power of social data insights from Synthesio&rsquo;s leading global social intelligence platform and integrate it with Conversocial&rsquo;s robust enterprise-class platform. The two platforms provide data and insight to each other, so brands can understand their consumers, provide relevant and appropriate customer service &ndash; measure the impact and then provide future service on updated insight. The Dialog Direct contract is one of a number of new customer wins secured by the partners based on this unique value proposition around social customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The feedback loop of social insight and social customer service is a no-brainer,&rdquo; said Steve Carrington, director, Dialog Direct. &ldquo;There is so much social data available on, and from, consumers that brands need to see, understand and then act on. Working with Conversocial in partnership with Synthesio gives us and our clients this powerful insight and capability.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">On selecting Conversocial and Synthesio, Carrington said: &ldquo;We wanted to work with best-in-class vendors and finding two providers that are market leaders and have the foresight to work together in a data-based capacity so that businesses can understand the social customer and then provide them with the best experiences and then feedback into the social analysis &ndash; it&rsquo;s a no-brainer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Synthesio&rsquo;s industry-leading social intelligence platform provides brands, agencies and enterprises with a complete picture of online data that matters to them.

<p class="responsiveNews">Conversocial enables brands to manage and resolve the social customer service inquiries across social media channels including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram and YouTube. The company&rsquo;s social customer service solution was described by Ovum as &ldquo;to resolve issues as well as providing a dashboard that helps organizations to view resolution rates alongside engagement metrics. By implementing tailored social support platforms like Conversocial&rsquo;s, businesses gain greater visibility into the success of their social customer service programs. &rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Joshua March, CEO and founder of Conversocial said: &ldquo;Our mission is to enable remarkable service to the social customer. We take technology and the power of data integrations seriously, so partnering with social media insight vendors such as Synthesio to give brands deep, relevant and actionable social data enables us to power unparalleled social service intelligence and processes. The team at Dialog Direct instantly recognized how compelling it is to be able to have greater depth of customer insight, to appropriately serve that customer then have the feedback on your actions &ndash; because great customer service is about the entire customer journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;At Synthesio, our goal has always been to provide customers with the most in-depth look at their social data and the health of their brand online, which of course includes customer service,&rdquo; explained Leah Pope, CMO of Synthesio. &ldquo;Through our partnership with Conversocial, customers like Dialog Direct can use our social data to build strategic and effective interactions with their customers, in the right places and the right times. The combined best in class technologies enable Dialog Direct to understand more about their customers, who they are and why they make the decisions they do, throughout the entire customer lifecycle.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Conversocial replaces an existing proprietary social customer service module which had been built by Dialog Direct&rsquo;s internal IT team, while Synthesio replaces an incumbent third-party software vendor.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Talking about the decision to implement Conversocial, Carrington said: &ldquo;We reviewed a number of social customer service solutions.  We looked at who was leading in the market according to source such as Gartner and then we approached Conversocial because we wanted to work with a market leader.  We chose Conversocial for two reasons: it was the most feature-rich solution but it was also a company that I knew from the beginning we could work with &ndash; the Conversocial team&rsquo;s attention to detail was phenomenal &ndash; I explained what we wanted to do from both a functional and economic point, and they listened and acted. &ldquo;We wanted a partner vendor that would continually invest in the product and not offer a product as sideline. Conversocial had the best solution.&rdquo;</p>
