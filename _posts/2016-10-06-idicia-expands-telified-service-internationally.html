IDICIAâs Telified service, which enables businesses and organizations to obtain status, carrier and device information for phone numbers based in the US will now support similar functionality for telephone numbers in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In the announcement, Garth Froese, PacificEastâs CEO stated, âThe Telified service has been a great success for us. But some of our larger, international customers have been requesting that we expand select services to support countries outside North America.â Mr. Froese stated that the United Kingdom and Ireland are the first two countries being supported but that the Telified service will be expanded into several more countries before the end of 2016. âBecause of differences from country to country, our technology and data quality teams require time to integrate and thoroughly test the quality of content in each country. We will be launching each country as soon as we are confident that the results are worthy of the IDICIA brand because organizations rely on Telified for critical parts of their business.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">PacificEastâs announcement stated the United Kingdom is already available as of October 1st and that Ireland is scheduled to come online October 7th. More information is available at http://www.idicia.com/telified.</p>
