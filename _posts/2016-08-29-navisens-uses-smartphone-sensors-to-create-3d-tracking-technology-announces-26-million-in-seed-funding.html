<p>Today, software-based location platform <a href="http://www.navisens.com">Navisens</a> announced $2.6 million in seed funding led by Resolute Ventures with participation from KEC Ventures, Amicus Capital, Arba Seed Investment Group, and angel investor Gokul Rajaram. The company is also introducing its patent-pending technology, motionDNA, a location solution that employs motion sensors in smartphones which is more reliable than GPS outdoors and much more accurate than alternative location solutions indoors.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;GPS has become ubiquitous, and that&rsquo;s actually a big problem for developers trying to create apps that work in urban environments or need a more refined reading of movement,&rdquo; said Dr. Ashod Donikian, CEO and founder of Navisens. &ldquo;GPS wasn&rsquo;t created for use in urban environments, no matter how much it&rsquo;s assisted by cell towers and WiFi access points or Bluetooth beacons. But every smartphone comes with motion sensors, which our software reads in a unique way so that it can tell where your phone is located indoors, outdoors, and underground, along with the direction it&rsquo;s facing and whether the device is stationary or in-use.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Navisens dramatically reduces the time and cost of deploying location indoors by eliminating both the need for installation of infrastructure such as WiFi access points and Bluetooth beacons, and &ldquo;fingerprinting&rdquo; the environment, a time-consuming procedure of manually traversing locations within a building and recording signal &ldquo;fingerprints&rdquo; throughout every floor. This means that Navisens location technology can operate in an environment without ever having to visit the environment beforehand. Constantly updating signal fingerprints due to hardware issues with WiFi access points and Bluetooth beacons is never required. This also removes the need for constant maintenance and removes barriers to scale across several floors and multiple properties.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Navisens technology is used by shopping malls to guide and interact with their customers, enterprise companies to improve the efficiency and safety of their workforce, vehicle navigation apps to improve navigation accuracy and routing efficiency, and Augmented Reality (AR) applications which are currently limited by existing location technologies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Navisens&rsquo;s motionDNA technology is available as a native SDK for iOS and Android, and also as a web API to process sensor data within the browser without requiring an app to be installed on the phone. This is a huge advantage for software developers looking to interact with users and understand location-based behaviors of users, which in turn informs how to engage with users in-app and in-browser.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Navisens is ahead of the curve in solving problems around indoor and outdoor tracking,&rdquo; said Raanan Bar-Cohen, Co-Founder and Partner at Resolute Ventures, who led the seed round. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking forward to seeing them grow quickly and effectively under Ashod&rsquo;s leadership.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About Navisens </strong><br />Navisens is a location platform that operates indoors and outdoors without relying on infrastructure such as WiFi Access Points (APs), Bluetooth Beacons, or GPS. Instead, Navisens processes data from the accelerometers and gyroscopes built into mobile devices, applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to achieve much greater accuracy and granularity. Navisens also provides additional information such as the orientation of the device and whether the device is stationary, in-use, or in-motion, all in real time.
