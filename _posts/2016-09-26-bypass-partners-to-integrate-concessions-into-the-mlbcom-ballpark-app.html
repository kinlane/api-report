The partnership will begin by integrating Bypass&rsquo;s mobile web commerce solution into the award-winning MLB.com Ballpark app, enabling fans to place and pay for concessions orders from their phones anywhere in participating MLB ballparks. This integration enables mobile ordering today while also building a foundation of technical collaboration to accelerate future commerce innovations.</p>
<p>Bypass was chosen by MLBAM for its wide range of mobile payment product support, ease of integration into the MLB.com Ballpark app, robust full-venue commerce capabilities, and agility to enable future innovation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to partner with the most innovative player in sports technology. It&rsquo;s not only a validation of all Bypass is doing, but also a great way to build deeper relationships with MLB franchises,&rdquo; added Brandon Lloyd, Bypass CEO.</p>
<p>In addition to the company&rsquo;s mobile commerce capabilities, Bypass also creates comprehensive solutions for front of house POS operations, back office management, and insights in the food and beverage market.

<p>&ldquo;Building an integration with Bypass into the Ballpark app will be another key development to delivering reliable, secure and easy-to-use commerce interactivity on fans&rsquo; personal devices when they&rsquo;re purchasing food, beverage and official merchandise,&rdquo; remarked Adam Ritter, MLBAM Wireless SVP.</p>
