<p><a href="http://www.macadamian.com">Macadamian Technologies</a>, a full-service software design and development firm, today announced the launch of the Macadamian HealthConnect&trade; platform to streamline the development of healthcare software solutions. Using the HealthConnect platform as a basis for custom healthcare software applications allows Macadamian to focus immediately on innovation and the differentiating capabilities. This means reduced development costs and a much faster time to market than starting application development from scratch.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Detailed demonstrations of the HealthConnect platform will be provided at the mHealth Summit conference (booth 1117) from November 8-11, 2015 in Washington, DC. mHealth Summit is the premier conference and expo for exploring what is new in mobile, telehealth, and connected health.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are excited to demonstrate the Macadamian HealthConnect platform at mHealth Summit,&rdquo; said Geoff Parker, Director of HealthCare Software Development at Macadamian. &ldquo;The demonstration will highlight how the HealthConnect platform removes the overhead of designing and developing user management and administration for new healthcare software solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Designed specifically for healthcare, the HealthConnect platform provides a core user management model including role based permissions and auditing capability needed by healthcare applications. The user management model maps the relationships between patients and their care team, and ensures healthcare regulatory compliance right out of the box. Once the framework is in place, Macadamian software application developers can focus on custom feature development and not on developing the mundane underlying framework.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Key features of the Macadamian HealthConnect platform include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Role-based user management meeting HIPAA requirements </li>
<li>Flexible security framework following HIPAA best practices </li>
<li>FHIR-based data model for interoperability</li>
<li>Easy-to-use admin portal </li>
<li>User relationship management</li>
<li>Extensible care team API</li>
<li>Detailed audit logging</li>
</ul>
