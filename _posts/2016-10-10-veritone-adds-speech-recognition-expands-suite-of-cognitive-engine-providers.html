This collaboration is expected to add new speech recognition capabilities to Veritoneâs growing list of cognitive engines.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Speech recognition allows users of Veritoneâs CMP to accurately, quickly and affordably identify words and phrases in customer interactions to build custom predictive solutions found in historical and transactional data. Identifying these patterns enables users of VoiceBaseâs cognitive engine to identify and optimize opportunities and risks.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âVoiceBaseâs contribution to Veritoneâs CMP is central to our machine learning capabilities, allowing us to analyze recorded audio with unprecedented granularity,â said Chad Steelberg, Chairman and CEO of Veritone. âTheir highly accurate transcription quickly recognizes specific words being spoken in a recording that can transform audio into actionable intelligence. Finding relationships and trends between words provides insight that was previously extremely difficult to extract, giving our customers an edge over their competitors,â added Steelberg.</p>
