SQL Server 2005 applications will run in WinDocks containers on Windows Server 2012 with improved security and support, using Docker commands and API.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âInterest in WinDocks SQL Server containers has exploded since WinDocks 1.0 was launched, and weâre responding to customer demand for SQL Server 2005,â said Paul Stanton, VP and co-founder of WinDocks. âWinDocks currently supports SQL Server 2008, 2008r2, 2012, and 2014, so adding support for SQL Server 2005 is a logical next step. Customers can extend the useful life of SQL Server 2005 applications, while upgrading the host to Windows Server 2012 and benefit from an agile support infrastructure.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">WinDocks SQL Server containers are based on a port of the Docker Engine, the defacto container standard. Using WinDocks SQL Server containers, organizations can start Docker based development and operations, and align with Microsoftâs support of the Docker API in Windows Server 2016. Industry surveys show that Windows Server 2012 will continue to grow share-of-usage for the next 3-4 years.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">WinDocks is already used to provide workload portability between on-premise and Public Cloud. WinDocks has collaborated with NetApp to demonstrate a containerized application is provisioned in the cloud, using a private ~1 TB database, in just 45 seconds (see https://youtu.be/2IRNx-6d4Oc ). WinDocks containers are lightweight and a team is supported with identical container environments on a single VM.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Availability of SQL Server 2005 containers is slated for later this Spring. WinDocks 1.0 is available in two versions. WinDock Standard includes .NET and Windows application containers. WinDocks SQL+ adds SQL Server support. Developers licenses are available for $249/year. <br />WinDocks is also available for a no-cost, cloud hosted Test Drive.
