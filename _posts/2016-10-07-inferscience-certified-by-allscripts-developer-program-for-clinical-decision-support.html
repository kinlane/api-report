<li>Save valuable time looking up clinical recommendations</li>
<li>Make informed clinical decisions at the point of care</li>
<li>Provide optimum guideline and standards-based care</li>
<li>Improve patient outcomes</li>
</ul>

With one click, an evidence-based recommendation is delivered to the provider in seconds during the patient&rsquo;s encounter. Infera validates a clinician&rsquo;s diagnosis or offers a new recommendation.</p>
