Once the extension is enabled, any registered attendees will automatically receive the document for signature and any new registered attendees will receive the document as they join. HelloSign Waivers & Forms is currently the exclusive eSignature and document management extension available to Eventbrite customers and can be accessed now in Eventbrite Spectrum.</p>
