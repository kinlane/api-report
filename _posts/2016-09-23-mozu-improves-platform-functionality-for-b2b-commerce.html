<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/mozu_logo.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /><a href="https://www.mozu.com/">Mozu</a>, the modern cloud commerce platform, today announced the launch of its latest service update, offering the tools and services that B2B companies require to excel in e-commerce. Sellers in this space demand powerful tools to make business possible. From pricing to transaction, Mozu&rsquo;s Admin tools make maintenance and administration easy, enabling companies to create a site specific to their customers and business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More and more, how businesses sell to consumers influences how businesses sell to each other,&rdquo; said Jonathan Roeder, vice president of architecture at Mozu. &ldquo;Expectations are changing. Modern businesses need a commerce platform that continues to push the bounds of retail innovation and delivers B2B functionality that meets consumer-influenced expectations. That platform is Mozu."</p>
<p>Mozu&rsquo;s updated features deliver improved B2B support while providing the customization customers demand. With Mozu&rsquo;s new price list feature, companies can incentivize their customers with special pricing, defining multiple price lists and assigning specific customers to each. Price lists can be customized in a variety of ways, allowing companies to differentiate by product or region in addition to implementing volume pricing based on quantity per product. The ability to define lists in this way enables companies to give the best deals to their most loyal customers and encourages bigger purchases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mozu's new B2B features will allow our brands to provide incentive-based programs to our customers, encourage larger sales volumes and attract wholesale accounts,&rdquo; said Andrew Krasner, director of e-commerce and marketing at VOLT Lighting.</p>
<p>A growing list of B2B brands are turning to Mozu to simplify enterprise commerce. Mozu&rsquo;s continued advancements in B2B commerce capabilities will help companies accelerate business growth, optimize the bottom line and quickly integrate innovative customer experiences into their sites.</p>
<p>With the latest update, when it comes time to pay, customers can use purchase orders to pay for their goods, keeping business streamlined. These can be defined by spending limits, net payment terms and other controls, keeping customers in-the-know on their payment obligations. In addition to Mozu&rsquo;s standard audit log, retailers also have access to a transaction log, where administrators can view transactions against a purchase order balance with no special bookkeeping or codes needed. Purchase orders can also be synced with external tools through Mozu&rsquo;s API, which provides all the end points to connect merchants&rsquo; financial management software suite.</p>
<p>Managing these features is simple with Mozu&rsquo;s Site Builder. For example, when designing pages, companies can easily preview content as well as price lists and scheduled pricing changes. Within Mozu&rsquo;s administrative suite, retailers can also better define who should be allowed to perform what actions or see what products and content through customer account hierarchies. For instance, combining parent-child relationships with Mozu&rsquo;s inheritance feature will save further setup and maintenance time.</p>
<p>Mozu&rsquo;s latest updates, in addition to its existing features, extend the B2B functionality of the platform and allow merchants to better customize their site for their specific business needs. Mozu&rsquo;s end-to-end solution delivers everything businesses need to excel in B2B commerce, with minimal time and effort required.</p>
