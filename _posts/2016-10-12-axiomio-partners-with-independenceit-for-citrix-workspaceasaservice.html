<p>IndependenceIT, a workspace automation software platform provider that allows IT departments, service providers and ISVs to easily deliver workspaces, applications and data from any cloud infrastructure, today announced the company&rsquo;s partnership with AxiomIO, a Newark, California-based provider of high performance cloud computing solutions for SMBs and the enterprise. AxiomIO is standardizing on Cloud Workspace&reg; automation to enhance deployment tasks, operational workflow, and administrative control of its Citrix Workspace-as-a-Service (WaaS) solution.</p>
<p>The AxiomIO Citrix WaaS solution empowers business users with on-demand access to their computing desktops, applications, and data anytime and from any device. The AxiomIO offering is a complete IT workspace solution delivered as a cloud service with predictable, pay-as-you-go monthly billing. With greater IT simplicity, flexibility, affordability, and user productivity, the AxiomIO WaaS solution provides businesses with a high value alternative to locally managed IT.</p>
<p>By enhancing the AxiomIO Citrix WaaS solution and control of its all-flash hyper-converged Software Defined Data Center environment with IndependenceIT, the company is able to significantly reduce its cost to manage these environments. IndependenceIT&rsquo;s Cloud Workspace software has also allowed AxiomIO to unlock the full potential of WaaS with its automation and enhanced workflows that also allow AxiomIO to delegate controls to customers as requested. The resources saved in terms of time and expense have been proven across IndependenceIT&rsquo;s partner ecosystem and will be significant in increasing AxiomIO&rsquo;s service margins.</p>
<p>Built on cloud infrastructure and powered by the integration of IndependenceIT&rsquo;s Cloud Workspace and Citrix solutions, including Netscaler*, XenDesktop*, and XenApp*, AxiomIO is able to more efficiently serve its customers with a platform that requires fewer capital and operational resources. Cloud Workspace software integrates with XenServer* to centralize and streamline management, resulting in a turnkey platform that offers greater administrative controls. IndependenceIT also provides auditing capabilities which support regulatory compliance by providing greater accountability of all actions for enhanced oversight and reporting.</p>
