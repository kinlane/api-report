<p><a href="http://www.cirius.com">Cirius Messaging Inc.</a>, a provider of cloud-based private email encryption, secure file sharing and advanced message control, in partnership with Ingram Micro, the world&rsquo;s largest distributor of technology products, today announced a new secure messaging bundle for the healthcare industry. The all-in-one bundle combines Cirius&rsquo; secure messaging and Microsoft Office 365 to help healthcare organizations secure emails and files and maintain compliance.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Created specifically for healthcare organizations such as medical and dental practices, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers, this new bundle includes a unique cloud-based solution that allows them to replicate traditional on-premises gateway appliance functionality in the cloud, making way for expanded file sharing and more advanced, flexible control of messaging.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">As mobile devices have become integral healthcare tools, healthcare organizations require security and privacy for all devices: smartphones, tablets and laptops. The bundled healthcare solution secures private emails, encrypts large files and controls messages sent to internal employees, external providers and patients on any device. Importantly, the easy-to-use cloud-based solution simplifies email data security and file sharing across healthcare organizations of all sizes.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Healthcare organizations have been precluded from the financial and administrative benefits of cloud-based email due to concerns about data security and regulatory compliance,&rdquo; said Josef Lara, SVP Business Development, Cirius.  &ldquo;This bundle allows us to not only enhance Microsoft Office 365 with easy-to-use messaging, file sharing security and advanced controls, but also fulfill the data privacy requirements of healthcare providers, enabling them to take advantage of the benefits of cloud-based email.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Cirius secure messaging solution is differentiated by its:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Unique, true-cloud architecture that requires no configuration of existing email infrastructure, no MX records to transfer and no gateway to install and manage.</li>
<li> Advanced message control, which includes tracking, delivery slip forward and reply freeze, and other advanced features.</li>
<li> Ability to secure messages on any device, including smartphones, tablets and laptops.</li>
<li> Seamless integration with Microsoft Outlook, Office 365 OWA and other browser-based webmail clients. </li>
<li> Simplified guest user registration and user experience with a web-based interface that precludes the need for any downloads or complex gateway installations. </li>
<li> Powerful APIs for integration into secure webforms, fax replacement, email archive repositories and other cloud platforms.</li>
<li> Simple &ldquo;one price&rdquo; subscription model that requires no substantial upfront expense or complicated add-on features.</li>
</ul>
