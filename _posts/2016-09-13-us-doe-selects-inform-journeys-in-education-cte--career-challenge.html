<p>Innovation to help middle and high school students assess skills and interests, and offer accessible information on occupations, education options, CTE, credentials, and career-seeking skills is the focus of the U.S. DoE Reach Higher Career Challenge, spearheaded by First Lady Michelle Obama. INFORM Journeys makes the grade and has been named a finalist in the national competition.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Journeys engages students in exploring possibilities, plotting life&rsquo;s major transitions, and setting goals. Journeys works like Google Maps&trade;, but for navigating&nbsp;K-12, CTE, college/university, military service and/or vocational training&nbsp;using an interactive map. Select a destination and Journeys will calculate the time to get there, provide detailed pathways to the selected destination and offer individualized assistance. Each personalized learning map can be saved, shared, and modified at any time.&nbsp;Journeys&nbsp;is the gateway to exploring lifelong learning with directions to guide the trip. See Journeys in action by watching our 3 minute video.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We believe Journeys is a game changer when it comes to providing students and educators support for educational and career path decision-making,&rdquo; said Peter Sibley, who has led the Journeys effort. &ldquo;Journeys interactive learning map will provide users with an engaging platform so they are able to control the pace, path and context of both their short-term and long-term decision making. Every learner will use Journeys learning maps within five years. Current technology will go the way of floppy disks.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Journeys includes integrated real-time career interest surveys, assessments and personalized teacher and student dashboards to track and monitor progress. Journeys has access to content from hundreds of the world&rsquo;s best publishers. Thousands of education, training and career choices are easy to explore using the Journeys map. Users can browse through data provided by O*NET, which includes 22 major career clusters with 1,800 careers to select their career destinations. For each journey created, the learning concepts, as well as the skills and knowledge that must be mastered are provided. Specific career openings are personalized by region through the INDEED&trade; API.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Launching in fall 2016, Journeys can be fully integrated with an educational organization, but most importantly does not need to be a part of an institutional system for students to carry on their lifelong learning journey or to have access to their performance data and learning resources. Users of all ages will retain access to their account for their lifetime. This open access provides users the ability to more completely understand what they need to master, and how that mastery will be connected to what they need to learn to reach their goals.</p>
