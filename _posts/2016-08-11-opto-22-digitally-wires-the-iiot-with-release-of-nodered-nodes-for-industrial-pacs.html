<p>Industrial automation manufacturer and Internet of Things platform developer Opto 22 announces immediate availability of Node-RED nodes for its industrial programmable automation controllers (PACs), significantly decreasing IIoT application development time and complexity. These Node-RED nodes for PACs make it easier to prototype and develop applications for connecting physical assets to cloud applications. Node-RED nodes and a RESTful API for Opto 22 SNAP PAC R-series and S-series controllers are available free for download at <a href="http://developer.opto22.com">http://developer.opto22.com</a>.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Rapid IIoT Application Prototyping</strong><br />Linking technology assets and services together to build IIoT applications often requires layers of complex software development and long development cycles that quickly erode IIoT application ROI. Opto 22&rsquo;s Node-RED nodes for SNAP PAC programmable automation controllers enable nearly anyone to rapidly prototype and develop IIoT applications with Node-RED, opening a path to quickly connect legacy physical assets to the digital world of cloud services.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Node-RED for IIoT</strong><br />Node-RED is an innovative visual wiring tool to connect edge computing systems such as industrial automation controllers to cloud services such as Amazon Web Services&trade; (AWS) IoT, IBM&reg; Watson IoT, and Microsoft&reg; Azure&reg; in new and interesting ways. Created by Nick O&rsquo;Leary (@knolleary) and Dave Conway-Jones (@ceejay) of IBM Emerging Technologies, Node-RED is an open-source, cross-platform technology available on GitHub.com and npmjs.org, and is currently available for a variety of platforms, including OS X&reg;, Microsoft Windows&reg;, Linux&reg;, and Raspberry Pi&trade;, and cloud offerings like IBM Bluemix&reg; and AT&amp;T&reg; Flow. Built on the popular Node.js JavaScript runtime, Node-RED benefits from a large Node-RED library&mdash;containing over 500 prebuilt and ready-to-deploy nodes&mdash;allowing IIoT application developers to leverage existing software code and deploy it directly into their applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;I've been very impressed with the whole Node-RED project,&rdquo; said Jim Turner, Senior Software Developer at Opto 22. &ldquo;It's well run, polished, and of high quality, but still very practical and useful. It's been a pleasure to develop for their platform.&rdquo; At the time of this release, Node-RED has been downloaded from npmjs.org over 25,000 times in the last month.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Lowering the Technical Bar</strong><br />The Node-RED development environment offers a gradual and easily approachable learning curve for users of all levels and requires few to no programming skills. Instead, Node-RED takes advantage of preprogrammed, reusable code blocks called nodes. These nodes make IIoT application development simpler, easier to repeat, and faster to scale. Through a visual browserbased, drag-and-drop interface, Node-RED allows IIoT application developers to focus on identifying an opportunity and developing a solution, rather than building the components of an application from scratch.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Advanced JavaScript functions can also be created within the editor using a Function node. A built-in library lets developers save useful functions, templates, or node flows for re-use. The flows created in Node-RED are stored using the widely known JSON format, which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with other developers and applications, promoting the idea of social application development.</p>
