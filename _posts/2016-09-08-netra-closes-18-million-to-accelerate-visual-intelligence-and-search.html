<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_61696_netra_logo.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.netra.io">Netra, Inc.</a>, a leader in Visual Intelligence and Search, closed $1.85 million in Series Seed financing led by Launchpad Venture Group and NXT Ventures with participation from Zelkova Ventures, Mark Cuban, Berwind LLC and other prominent angels. This round brings total funding for Netra to $2.45 million, which will be used to accelerate team growth, product development and sales. Netra was a part of Techstars Boston 2015 class.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Netraâs solution helps make sense of the deluge of photos and videos posted online to gain a deeper understanding of consumer preferences and engagement points, and help drive visual discovery. The technology was developed from research at MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and leverages computer vision, deep learning and search.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Concurrent with the funding, Netra also announced signing an agreement with Kantar Group, one of the largest global data investment management firms, to license Netraâs proprietary IRIS Visual Intelligence software. Kantar is part of WPP plc, the worldâs largest advertising holding company, and includes other leading firms like Millward Brown, TNS, Added Value, Kantar Worldpanel, Lightspeed Research, and Kantar Media.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âKantarâs mission is to understand everything about the Consumer â their interests, intentions, likes and dislikes. With imagery quickly becoming the dominant form of expression for consumers, we needed a more automated solution to extract data and insights from the plethora of imagery. After many months of testing and evaluating alternatives, we found Netraâs solution to be the most accurate and robustâand importantly, one that was built to work with Kantarâs existing processes,â commented Mardien Drew, Head of Mobile and Incubation Technologies at Kantar. âWhile we are starting with photos, we are collaborating with Netra to quickly expand to video and future consumption platforms like augmented and virtual reality.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âNetra is solving the biggest of big data challenges by automatically organizing imagery and making it searchable with cutting-edge Computer Vision and Deep Learning technology,â added Raymond Nobu Chang, Managing Director of NXT Ventures. âNetra has developed solutions that we believe are more accurate and faster than those developed by the largest technology companies. More importantly, they solve a real pain point for enterprises that still rely on manual tagging, which is costly and inefficient. The team has identified critical short and longer-term markets to target â and had great initial success bringing on enthusiastic enterprise customers. Weâre excited to help fund this next phase of growth for Netra.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe couldnât be happier with the partners weâre announcing today,â said Richard Lee, CEO of Netra. âKantar is one of the most technologically-savvy and forward-thinking research firms out there, with some of the worldâs biggest brands as clients and the scale of WPP behind it. Weâre excited about what weâve delivered so far, but more excited about what weâre working on with Kantar. On the funding side, we were fortunate to find investors early on who believed in our team, our vision, and importantly helped us identify the best initial applications and markets to target. This round will allows us to bring on some exceptional talent to add to our already amazing team and deliver more innovation and value to our partners.â</p>
