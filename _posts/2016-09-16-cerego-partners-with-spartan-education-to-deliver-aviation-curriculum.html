<p class="responsiveNews">Beginning with preparation for the Certified Flight Instructor exam, Spartan College will leverage Ceregoâs personalized learning technology to help students optimize and improve their learning experience. Spartanâs flight training program and instruction are comprehensive, and provide students the opportunity to learn every topic and skill necessary to become a safe and qualified pilot in just 12 months. With Cerego, students are empowered to master this critical material with a quantified measurement for what they have learned and how much information they have retained.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âAs a leading aviation technology college, we are committed to providing our students with the best possible value and opportunities for success,â said Spartan CEO Peter H. Harris. âAviation education has yet to leverage the type of technology and insight that Cerego provides, and weâre thrilled to be at the forefront of personalized learning for our industry. We are confident that this partnership will be transformational, not only for our institution as a whole but for each individual student who experiences this approach to learning and retaining our coursework.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Cerego will also power the aviation maintenance program, aiding students in their ability to understand the intricacies of aircraft maintenance and inspection processes that are needed to keep airways safe.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOur collaboration with Spartan has validated the application of our personalized learning platform well beyond the traditional classroom,â said Andrew Smith Lewis, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Cerego. âTodayâs most competitive businesses no longer battle simply on the grounds of price or product, but rather over talent. In aviation, specifically, critical thinking is key to success. People are the essential element to todayâs strongest businesses, and the schools that can provide the best training and certification for emerging professionals will help shape the future of not only their students, but also their industries.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Ceregoâs personalized learning platform is built on proven memory science that drives knowledge retention and student engagement. As learners study with Cerego, the technology measures a studentâs rate of information absorption and memory decay and simultaneously calculates the precise moment to review that material in order to achieve maximum memory strength. Within the learning environment, Cerego provides each student with a personalized Memory Bank that provides a visualization of learning progress, and maps activation and memory strength across all items and individual items studied.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Cerego courses will be available to Spartan students in Summer 2016. For more information, please visit http://www.spartan.edu/programs/pilot-training.</p>
