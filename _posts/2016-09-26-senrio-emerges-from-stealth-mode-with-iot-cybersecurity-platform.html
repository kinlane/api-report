<p><a href="http://senr.io">Senrio</a>, an Internet of Things (IoT) cybersecurity solution, emerges from stealth mode with the launch of an IoT network cybersecurity platform that provides visibility and defense for networked embedded devices (NEDs) used in healthcare, critical infrastructure, retail and corporate environments.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The market needs a comprehensive answer to the IoT dilemma: A dramatic increase of deployed devices, high susceptibility to attacks due to inherent vulnerabilities and high value of the accessible assets. Today, there are few solutions to this challenge. However, Senrio offers a much-needed new approach,&rdquo; </em>said Christina Richmond, Program Director, Security Services, IDC.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We typically associate the term &lsquo;Internet of Things&rsquo; with the consumer world, smart toasters and WiFi fridges; however, a large part of our life depends on networked embedded devices that have been around for decades. Think of smart meters, medical devices, and connected industrial controllers used for elevators, traffic lights, and factories. Adoption is driven by business rationale but the security exposure is often overlooked. Based on my experience, there is not a single IoT device that cannot be compromised or misused by a determined attacker,&rdquo; </em>said Stephen Ridley, CEO of Senrio.</p>
<p>After years of conducting vulnerability research and reverse engineering in support of the U.S. Defense and Intelligence community, Stephen A. Ridley, CEO and founder of Senrio, turned his embedded device research capabilities towards creating a comprehensive solution to address inherent vulnerabilities in networked embedded devices deployed in billions across life- and mission-critical environments. Hailing from MIT, Draper Labs, ManTech, Tektronix, and McAfee, the Senrio team combines security research capabilities with product design expertise. The team has reverse-engineered numerous products and trained Fortune 500 companies on mobile security exploitation and protection, including the largest seller of Point-of-Sale systems, makers of consumer devices, as well as prominent mobile device companies.</p>
<p>Through the deployment of the Senrio Sensor, available as software, virtual machine or API integration, the company provides IoT network operational health and cybersecurity analytics by passively monitoring network traffic and creating device-specific behavior profiles. Senrio eliminates the conventional notion of false positives that is a common side effect of today&rsquo;s signature-based security technologies. Instead, Senrio automatically provides context-rich analytics based on adaptive algorithms and device-specific behavior. All this is done via a lightweight software deployment and seamless integration with existing dashboards, making Senrio incredibly scalable and maintainable for high-value networks across multiple industry verticals. It&rsquo;s like having a security camera for your embedded device network.</p>
<p>Senrio currently supports several enterprise customers through evaluation and API integration and closed its first round of financing led by Talis Capital, a London-based VC. Vasile Foca, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Talis Capital, explained, <em>&ldquo;Senrio have built a market-leading IoT cybersecurity solution which counters the inherent security risk within embedded devices. Deployment of embedded devices is set to grow significantly over the coming years; CISOs will need solutions that can monitor and identify vulnerabilities on their ever-expanding IoT networks. Stephen and the team have long been at the forefront of research in this field, and we believe they are uniquely positioned to help organisations manage security risks posed by growing numbers of embedded devices.&rdquo;</em></p>
