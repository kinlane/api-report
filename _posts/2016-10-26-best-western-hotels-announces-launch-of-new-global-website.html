The companyâs latest endeavor into optimizing and streamlining customer interactions across all digital channels, the reimagined site incorporates highly visual, interactive elements and responsively adapts to the screen size of the device a customer is using â whether that be a smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop PC. The result is an intuitive, image-rich, engaging online consumer experience.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âFor five consecutive years, BestWestern.com has won Dynatraceâs Best of the Web. That said, we knew that we needed to demonstrate agility with our digital presence in order to continue connecting with Todayâs Travelers,â said David Kong, Best Western Hotels & Resortsâ president and CEO. âOur team made the decision to start fresh, building a flexible new digital platform that would really resonate with our customers. We believe the new site will earn just as many if not more accolades as the last and that it will further position Best Western as an innovator as we progress through our 70th birthday year.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new BestWestern.com significantly reduces the number of steps and clicks needed to complete a booking and implements smart filters to help travelers find the perfect hotel. Integration of world-class technology, such as Googleâs Places API for mapping and nearby attractions, leverages the very best the web has to offer. Additionally, modifying travel plans or canceling online is now easier than ever.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOver the last thirteen months, Best Western has worked diligently to revitalize our customer serving technology,â said Greg Adams, Best Western Hotels and Resortsâ Chief Digital Officer. âWe are confident that our new brand website will enable us to engage with our guests in a more compelling, intuitive manner, delivering a superior customer experience along with increasing revenue for our hotel members.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The launch of Best Westernâs new brand website is part of an overall strategic investment into technology, one that is laying a solid yet flexible foundation for future enhancements. Additional recent deliveries include more than 2,000 new individual property websites - one for every hotel in North America. A new mobile website and new apps have also been introduced; increasing revenue delivery three fold from mobile devices. Each of these channels aims to bring consumer-driven features to the forefront, with dynamic search functions and components such as an engaging interactive map, which highlights nearby attractions and points of interest.</p>
