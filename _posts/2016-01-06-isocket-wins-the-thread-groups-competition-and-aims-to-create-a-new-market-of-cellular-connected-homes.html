<p><a href="http://threadgroup.org/">The Thread Group</a> was formed by seven industry-leading organizations including Yale Security, Silicon Labs, Samsung Electronics, Nest Labs, Freescale Semiconductor, Big Ass Fans and ARM. They developed Thread to provide a new and better way to connect products in the home.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We recognize that much of the innovation in the connected home will come from early-stage companies,&rdquo; said Chris Boross, president, the Thread Group and technical product manager at Nest Labs. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen incredible momentum in the last year, as our membership has grown to more than 220 companies. We&rsquo;re delighted that iSocket Systems will join our efforts to establish Thread as the most widely-adopted protocol powering the next generation of the connected home.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">iSocket Systems is a home automation company that is the innovator of smart plugs. Their smart plugs operate over the cellular network to send prompt alerts of a problem in the home, such as a power outage, leak, temperature rise/fall, break-in, gas leak, etc.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We have focused on cellular technology when Wi-Fi wasn&rsquo;t yet common in homes,&rdquo; tells Denis Sokol, CEO of iSocket Systems. &ldquo;While Wi-Fi is becoming the standard for internet connection in a home now, we believe that cellular network will continue play an important role in the IoT, particularly in smart homes. Moreover, for some applications - such as a power failure alert - Wi-Fi is powerless. We combined cellular and Thread to create a new market of cellular connected homes where users will be able to be in touch with their homes regardless of Wi-Fi or power availability, or location.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">CECO HOME is a combination of &ldquo;Thread to Cellular&rdquo; router &ndash; the heart of the new ecosystem, Thread-enabled devices connected wirelessly inside the home, and Open API (that allows anyone to build their own smart home monitoring services). CECO HOME can operate either as a stand-alone solution where Wi-Fi is not available (e.g. remote mountain cabin, caravan, etc.) or as a cellular backup solution for the entire Wi-Fi enabled home.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">An example of a stand-alone plug-and-play solution was presented to the board of Thread Group at the last All Members Meeting in France in November 2015 where Denis Sokol demonstrated how CECO HOME notifies users about a flood and power outage immediately without frustrating configuration and without Wi-Fi. This 3 minute demo met with a very positive reaction from the members.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Kevin Kraus &ndash; Director Product Management of Yale Locks - comments: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve seen an educational presentation showing an interesting application of Thread technology. The demo - where we saw how fast and how simply a customer can get an alert about a problem in his home - was interesting and enjoyed by all.&rdquo;</p>
