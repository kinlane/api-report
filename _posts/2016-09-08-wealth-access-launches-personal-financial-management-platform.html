<p class="responsiveNews">The Wealth Access âV3âenterprise platform is an industry leading, modular, client portal powered by best in class multi-tiered aggregation, advanced client reporting and dynamic mobile access for large financial institutions. By being an âaggregator of aggregators,â Wealth Access is able to go above and beyond providing an aggregated view of client holdings to be able to also tap into visual-aggregated displays of clientsâ entire financial situations, cash flow and budgeting, personal financial statements and integrations with financial planning systems through links to over 20,000 institutions via enterprise components and APIs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âIn todayâs post-DOL, post-Robo environment, financial services companies are looking to provide their advisors with the latest digital tools to enhance the client experience, comply with new DOL fiduciary requirements, as well as provide advanced productivity tools to their advisors,â said David Benskin, CEO of Wealth Access. âIn order to do so, financial servicesâ executives need to decide on whether to build, buy or rent these capabilities, a complex strategic decision. With our new V3 enterprise platform, firms can simplify that decision via the choice to deploy our end-to-end solution out of the box, configure specific components to their specifications, or design a complete custom system, all through one application.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new Wealth Access V3 platform is built on the latest technologies to provide a flexible solution for the enterprise. Through over 50 âplug and playâ widget applications (net worth views, cash flow analyses, asset allocation charts, financial planning analyses and more), firms are able to integrate specific components to complement and extend their existing technology or deploy a complete custom solution for their specific needs. Coming soon will also be a firm-wide dashboard that will roll up wallet-share opportunities of held-away assets, changes in client holdings, new business opportunities, and more to provide senior management with powerful business intelligence and a unique line of sight into their operations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âSpeed to market is a top concern for financial service companies as they look to catch up to new technology rivals as well as their historic competition,â Benskin said. âWhich is why we designed our system as flexible and customizable - the only independent, PFM and aggregation platform not owned by competitive financial services companies currently available. The combination of our aggregator of aggregator approach and powerful PFM client portal capabilities is truly unique in the marketplace.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Leading the new enterprise business unit for Wealth Access is newly hired Chief Revenue Officer, Jeff Bloedorn. Jeff is a 30-year fintech veteran focused on the wealth and retirement industry. He was most recently with FIS, one of the largest financial services technology companies in the world. Jeff will be responsible for customer success and will oversee the business development and relationship management for Wealth Access.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âJeff is a true leader in financial services technology,â said Benskin. âWe are very excited to have him on the team and are very confident that he will deliver outstanding results for our enterprise clients.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Wealth Access has seen explosive growth since its launch as a pioneer in high net worth PFM technology for advisors. "Our recent success with large financial services companies has spurred the deployment of our best-in-class user experience in a modular component architecture platform,â said Benskin.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âAs an industry, this is truly a tipping-point in wealth management where technology is having such a disruptive impact on the delivery of financial advice. We are truly looking forward to delivering a powerful solution to help firms continue to succeed in the new environment,â Benskin said.</p>
