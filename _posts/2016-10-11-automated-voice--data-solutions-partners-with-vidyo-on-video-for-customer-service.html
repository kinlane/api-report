<p class="responsiveNews">âOur research shows that companies can immediately improve their customersâ experience using our Vidyo/CIC integration,â said AVDS President Sharon Moon. âFor instance, claimants involved in an auto accident can engage with an adjuster via a video interaction to show damages on the spot, thus speeding up the claims process.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The integration, when used in conjunction with CICâs recording capabilities, can also enable supervisors and managers to review each video interaction to see if agents are being empathetic, thus further improving the customer experience.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The total video conferencing market is on a high growth trajectory and is forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2 percent from 2015 to 2020 to reach $11.44 billion by 2020 (Growth Opportunities in the Video Conferencing Market, Frost & Sullivan, June 2016).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Vidyo, already a major player in the video conferencing space, has been at the forefront of video-enabled communications in telemedicine, financial services and government. The Vidyo/CIC integration will significantly leverage Vidyo in contact centers that use CIC.</p>

We have seen a tremendous response to our video collaboration platform and Vidyo is pleased to have been selected by AVDS for this integration into the Interactive Intelligence CIC contact center platform,â said Bob Smith, Senior Vice President, Global Sales, Vidyo.</p>
