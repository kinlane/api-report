The Adara iC3 Platform intelligently integrates battery and inverter controls with cloud-based software and a robust IoT connectivity solution. The platform will initially launch with a scalable 125kW, 250kWh inverter and battery suitable for commercial-scale applications. Leveraging its significant traction in the residential market, the Adara iC3 solution addresses pent-up demand from its certified solar installers who also have a significant commercial customer base.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âCommercial-scale energy storage technology is transforming the economics of solar for companies seeking to mitigate the financial burden of demand charges and time-of-use rates,â said Neil Maguire, CEO of Adara Power. âCommercial customers require flexible and intelligent energy storage that is continuously monitored, updated and dispatchable via remote connections to third party aggregators. These capabilities were planned for in our system from the outset, enabling us to rapidly respond to changing electricity rate schedules and variable building loads.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">At the heart of the iC3 Platform is the Adara iC3 Controller â an intelligent hardware and firmware device that optimizes battery life and performance relative to a facilityâs electrical load demand. The iC3 controller is based on Adaraâs automotive control system and battery management semiconductor heritage, and is designed for wide temperature range, robust performance and cost effectiveness.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Adaraâs iC3 Cloud solution leverages an Amazon Web Services infrastructure to dynamically scale processing and data storage as its fleet of energy storage systems continues to expand and as historical data grows. The Adara iC3 Cloud monitors commercial energy storage installations in order to provide near real-time data on battery and inverter performance, as well as building loads. Building owners, facility managers and engineers can view reports, track detailed performance data, and configure alert notifications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Adara iC3 Connectivity solution includes device-to-cloud and cloud-to-cloud integration. A set of application programming interfaces (APIs) is available to enable integration to higher-level building energy management systems and for utility smart grid services. The device-to-cloud IoT layer includes standard communications interfaces such as Ethernet LAN 10/100 and Sprintâs machine-to-machine cellular connectivity. The system is capable of performing remote updates of firmware and the OS layer through the connectivity.</p>
