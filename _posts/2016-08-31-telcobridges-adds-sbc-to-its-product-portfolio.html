<p><a href="http://www.telcobridges.com"><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apievangelistsitenewstelco-logo3ec9d8506911dc8b41dadcfeadc4f735png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.telcobridges.com">TelcoBridges</a> today announced that it has added a Session Border Controller (SBC) product to its portfolio with the introduction of Tsbc. TelcoBridges&rsquo; new Tsbc helps service providers of all sizes facilitate VoIP-based network interconnections with other carriers and increase revenues due to its extensive and flexible call routing features.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Over the last decade, our media gateways have been deployed in more than 100 countries, and our new Tsbc product inherits the proven interoperability and reliability that TelcoBridges is known for,&rdquo; said Richard Gendron, CEO of TelcoBridges. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve listened to what our customers need, and the addition of the SBC product to our portfolio was a logical evolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">TelcoBridges&rsquo; Tsbc enables high performance SIP-to-SIP translation (B2BUA), transcoding, access to the full SIP header to adapt signalling between carrier networks, and unmatched call routing capabilities, providing the ability to implement any routing scheme. Tsbc supports a full set of management tools to configure, monitor and provision, including a machine-to-machine interface using a RESTful JSON API for integration with operations support systems (OSS). Tsbc also protects network infrastructure from DoS and Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new Tsbc integrates seamlessly with TelcoBridges media gateways, and the TB Analytics network troubleshooting tools offer a unique toolkit to accelerate deployments and facilitate network operations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Tsbc offering is designed for service providers, wholesale carriers, or competitive service providers that need to interconnect with other carriers using VoIP. It facilitates cost-effective carrier-grade deployments, and provides the reliability that TelcoBridges&rsquo; media gateways are known for. Tsbc features an array of security protection features that bring additional peace-of-mind to carriers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Tsbc Session Border Controller will ship in September 2016. For more information contact TelcoBridges at 450 655 8993 x133 or info(at)telcobridges(dot)com.</p>
