<p><a href="http://www.phantom.us">Phantom</a>, the first company to provide an open, extensible, and community-powered security automation and orchestration platform, has extended its lead since entering the market and being named RSA Conference 2016&rsquo;s Most Innovative Startup earlier this year. Product innovation, plus growth with partners and playbooks shows the strength of a community-powered approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Security automation and orchestration has become a top priority for organizations,&rdquo; said Oliver Friedrichs, Founder &amp; CEO of Phantom. &ldquo;This has driven strong interest in our platform, our partner ecosystem, and the playbooks our community has developed. The innovation and growth proves that reducing time spent on tedious and repetitive tasks through automation is becoming a must-have means of increasing the capacity of security teams and driving consistency for more accurate results.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Product</strong></p>
<p>Phantom 2.0 became generally available in late September. Fueled by feedback from customers and the community, this release delivered more than 500 enhancements including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"> <span class="bwuline">Playbook Editor 2.0</span> for Tier 3 Analysts to visually create automation playbooks. The new Playbook Editor provides a new experience through a rich, visual, BPMN-based (Business Process Model &amp; Notation) editor enabling users to create playbooks more easily, with or without coding skills.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"> <span class="bwuline">Mission Control 2.0</span> for Tier 1 Analysts to triage security events and alerts more efficiently. The details of the incident, triage, status, and results are presented in a single view, speeding the event and alert triage process for security operations teams. Mission Control also introduces an Activity Feed that is a Slack-like interface enabling collaboration and commenting between all team members working on an event or alert.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"> <span class="bwuline">Onboarding Process</span> to get new users executing automated playbooks in less than 5 minutes. The process allows users to quickly configure a data source like a SIEM platform, threat intelligence feed, email message, RESTful API, or sample data, and then configure security tools utilized in the playbook before enabling the automation playbook to execute.</li>
</ul>
