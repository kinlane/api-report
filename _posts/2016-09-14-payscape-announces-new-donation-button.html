<p>Atlanta-based financial technology company <a href="https://payscape.com/">Payscape</a> announced today that it has added integrated donation capabilities to its proprietary eCommerce platform, Vendevor. The donation features provide a web-based outlet for both businesses and nonprofits, streamlining the process of receiving charitable contributions. The product update aims to target organizations such as nonprofits, schools, churches, kickstarters and crowdfunding endeavors.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Thousands of companies already use Payscape&rsquo;s line of SaaS products to compliment their business needs. The addition of donation capabilities is an opportunity to expand the existing financial technology options that Payscape offers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Some of the most anticipated features within the new donation capabilities include variant contribution, recurring contribution, email integration, and the highly-visual donation progress bar. These features are specifically designed to meet the needs of every philanthropic effort.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to website-based giving, Payscape can also integrate donation capabilities directly to an organization&rsquo;s Facebook page. With a simple add-on, companies can now accept and monitor donation amounts along with the color-coded progress bar. <br />&ldquo;This feature allows Payscape to provide services to a full spectrum of industries. We&rsquo;re passionate about supporting nonprofits, and with the technology to accept recurring donations through a variety of templates and payment options, we hope to achieve increased donations for all of our nonprofit partners,&rdquo; said Doug Hardman, Chief Technology Officer.</p>
