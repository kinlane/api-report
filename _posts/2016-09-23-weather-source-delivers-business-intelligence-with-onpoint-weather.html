<p><a href="http://weathersource.com/hyper-local-past-present-and-forecast-worldwide-weather-data-for-business-intelligence">Weather Source LLC</a>, the world&rsquo;s leading provider of on-demand past, present, and forecast weather data is now offering the next generation of OnPOINT Weather. The result of years of research by top meteorologists, mathematicians, and data scientists, OnPOINT Weather is used by the majority of Fortune 50 companies to provide critical weather-related business intelligence and actionable insights that can increase revenues and lower costs.</p>
<p>OnPOINT Weather leverages an array of inputs, including ground-based radar data, space-based satellite data, weather station observations, and a suite of weather models to provide a continuum of past, present, and forecast weather conditions, on hourly and daily increments, for millions of locations around the globe. The OnPOINT Weather system intelligently fuses meteorological and statistical analysis to identify and correct data errors, producing unparalleled accuracy and reliability within a comprehensive global weather data set that is clean and gap free back to January 1, 2000.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By incorporating OnPOINT Weather into business intelligence platforms,&rdquo; said Mark Gibbas, President and CEO of Weather Source LLC, &ldquo;companies can perform detailed weather analytics to uncover insights into how weather impacts sales, marketing, operations, and ultimately their bottom line. OnPOINT Weather gives companies the comprehensive weather data they need to quantify weather impacts to their business to optimize processes and increase profit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a huge value proposition,&rdquo; said Weather Source user Cameron Williams of Domo Inc., &ldquo;as it makes it extremely easy to compare weather correlations across multiple locations at one time. We supply clients with out-of-the-box connectors that allow them to directly link to live weather data they can use to correlate to their business and add an incredibly powerful predictive statement to their business story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OnPOINT Weather provides hourly and daily weather values along with associated hourly and daily climate information to provide context for determining if conditions are above or below normal. &ldquo;The ability to provide a comparison to normal weather can be very valuable,&rdquo; said Gibbas. &ldquo;A temperature of 50&deg;F in February is above normal in Boston, where people will be shedding coats and seeking some fun outside, but 50&deg;F in Miami means people are bundled up and hunkered down. Consumer behavior is often driven by the departure from normal temperature, rather than temperature directly and OnPOINT Weather provides the means to quantify this across different locales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OnPOINT Weather packages are available for a wide range of business needs and can be easily integrated with most BI platforms via the Weather Source API. See www.weathersource.com/bi to learn more about OnPOINT Weather.</p>
