<p><a href="https://www.springcm.com/">SpringCM</a>, a leading document and sales contract management solution for Salesforce customers, today announced <a href="https://www.springcm.com/g1">G|1 Docs</a> &ndash; the one cloud document management solution Salesforce customers need to generate, edit, share, approve and track files across teams and organizations. G|1 Docs complements Salesforce&rsquo;s strengths as the standard for customer data, providing an enterprise-class solution to store, share, and work with any type of business document within the Salesforce environment.</p>
<p>G|1 Docs combines all the benefits of a centralized, searchable repository with rich document and content management functionality, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"> <strong>Document Generation:</strong> Dynamically merge data from Salesforce to build documents that can be shared for approval and signature and collaborate on documents with the rest of the team. Pre-approved templates pull relevant data from any source, reducing the sales cycle and increasing revenue.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"> <strong>Document Management:</strong> Collaborate, tag, categorize, store, and find any document on any file from within Salesforce. Robust tagging and searching functions let users quickly locate the right document from any data source using any device.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb"> <strong>Document Workflow:</strong> Automate workflows for document-centric businesses. Review, approve, reject, track activity, compare, audit trail. Document-driven processes use predefined data to reduce human error, automate distribution and approved version with minimal clicks.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;G1 Docs bridges the gap between sales data and documents for Salesforce customers, accelerating revenue cycles with an end-to-end process,&rdquo; said Antonis Papatsaras, Chief Technology Officer of SpringCM. &ldquo;By bringing everything together with our native integration to Salesforce, organizations can go further, connecting Salesforce Einstein insights with SpringCM&rsquo;s Intelligent Platform utilizing, machine learning and natural language processing to connect the dots in business processes for even more powerful results.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Document Sharing, Point Solutions and SharePoint</strong></p>
<p>More than 150,000 companies use Salesforce as their standard for managing customer data. But when it comes to business files, many are experiencing &ldquo;app fatigue,&rdquo; struggling to manage complex processes with a disconnected mix of point solutions while critical documents are stored in a silo of content solutions. These companies can benefit from moving to a standard for business documents, unifying their cloud document repositories, such as Box and Dropbox, and legacy Enterprise Content Management systems, such as SharePoint, Documentum and FileNet.</p>
<p>SpringCM developed G|1 Docs because Salesforce customers want to ensure users can put relevant documents to work for the right people at the right time to generate the right results. Salesforce customers need a single document management solution with strong integration to Salesforce objects, far more than simply connecting a document repository through an API. And they need that system to minimize risk and adapt to evolving regulatory mandates that require greater transparency on how documents are created, reviewed, approved and shared both inside and outside an organization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;SpringCM has the unique ability to address a key gap in cloud content services by combining document generation, document management and document workflow in a single solution that is specifically designed for Salesforce customers,&rdquo; said Greg Buchholz, CEO of SpringCM. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just far too difficult to expect employees to engage with a tangle of workflow widgets, document portals and development tools, and it&rsquo;s too hard for companies to make it all work together. G|1 Docs is the one solution from a single provider enterprises need to move their organizations forward.&rdquo;</p>
