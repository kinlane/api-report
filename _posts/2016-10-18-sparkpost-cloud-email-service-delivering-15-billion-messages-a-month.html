<p><a href="http://sparkpost.com">SparkPost</a>, the most performant cloud email delivery service available, today announced it has surpassed the 15 billion messages per month milestone, despite having been generally available for just 18 months.&nbsp; Moreover, SparkPost continues to increase the volume of messages delivered by more than 1 billion month over month, making it the fastest-growing cloud email service on the market. SparkPAost's now 15,000+ active customers range from small startups to fast-growing major technology companies including Pinterest, Zillow, CareerBuilder, LinkedIn, and Intercom.</p>

<p><strong>Developers' Preferred Service.</strong> SparkPost is now the preferred choice of developers for API-driven email delivery. This was evidenced by the recent migration of many Mandrill users to SparkPost after Mailchimp announced it would no longer be available as a standalone service. The resulting surge of users to SparkPost was captured in a recent Notablist report analyzing the Mandrill market disruption; this analysis found that over 21 percent selected SparkPost &ndash; 5 percent ahead of the closest competitor &mdash; prompting Notablist to state that "<em>SparkPost Won the Battle for New Users</em>."</p>
<p><strong>True Cloud Reliability.</strong> SparkPost quickly has developed a reputation as the most reliable and flexible email delivery service provider. Unlike other email delivery providers who continue to expend resources and focus on building and maintaining their own datacenters, SparkPost is the only full-featured cloud email delivery service built 100 percent for the modern cloud.&nbsp; SparkPost's leverage of Amazon Web Services, the industry's preeminent Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform, allows customers and partners alike to experience the benefits of a secure, scalable, and elastic cloud infrastructure -- like guaranteed burst rates -- while allowing SparkPost to remain focused on developing and expanding its core service offerings and technical innovations.</p>
<p><strong>Premier Partnerships.</strong> The company's impressive list of partners continues to grow, totaling 30, including strategic partnerships with innovative marketing technology (MarTech) companies such as Iterable and Boomtrain. These marketing application providers give SparkPost customers the combined benefit of leading-edge MarTech functionality with the high-performing email delivery service that is SparkPost's clear focus.</p>
<p>"2016 has proven, thus far, to be our most successful to date," said <span class="xn-person"><span>Phillip Merrick</span></span>, CEO of SparkPost. "Surpassing 15 billion cloud email messages per month &ndash; nearly half of our chief competitor's volume &ndash; in such a short time is remarkable, given how long each solution has been in the market. Additionally, we've found that their former customers who have switched to SparkPost are actually more successful without the limitations of a dated technology architecture; many wonder why they didn't become our customer sooner! These achievements serve as proof that SparkPost is the new leader in cloud email delivery services."</p>
