<p class="responsiveNews">Hyperwallet further revealed that it had recruited Dan Harrison, a technical solutions expert with a long history of customer advocacy, to head up the program. Harrison will be responsible for fostering relationships within the wider developer community, as well as showcasing the functionality of Hyperwalletâs API integration options.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âDan is unique both in his ability to rapidly understand complex technology and in his ability to explain its value in a simple, engaging way,â said Bill Crowley, Hyperwalletâs Chief Product Officer. âHyperwallet is already pushing the boundaries of whatâs possible in outbound payments. Danâs technical expertise will help us further demonstrate to businesses that utilize independent workforcesâgig platforms, digital marketplacesâjust how easy it is to integrate Hyperwalletâs truly global payout.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The announcement comes as Hyperwallet continues to pioneer new and innovative technology in the outbound payment space. Three members of the Hyperwallet developer team were credited as inventors for a Hyperwallet patent application recently filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the technology behind the companyâs JavaScript payout widget, which enables clients to embed payout functionality directly into new or existing applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Anyone interested in getting a closer look at Hyperwalletâs global payout infrastructure is encouraged to join the companyâs developer team at FinDEVr Silicon Valley from October 18-19, where Crowley will take the stage to give a live demonstration of Hyperwalletâs developer toolkit.</p>
