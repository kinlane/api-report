Through the Points Loyalty Commerce Platform, members of Dominoâs Puntos, the newly introduced loyalty program for Dominoâs Pizza in the Dominican Republic, can redeem Dominoâs Puntos for JetBlue TrueBlue points.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"This partnership signifies our commitment to represent our partners and expand our services in new markets,â said Rob MacLean, CEO of Points. âWeâre excited to launch our second initiative in the Dominican Republic, and weâre honored to unite our long-time partner JetBlue and their TrueBlue loyalty program with Dominoâs Puntos. This partnership will add tremendous value to members of both programs.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âJetBlue is the Dominican Republic's largest airline, with more flights in and out of the country than any other carrier. We are excited to offer even more opportunities for our Dominican TrueBlue members,â said Scott Resnick, director loyalty marketing, JetBlue. âOur new partnership with Dominoâs Dominican Republic provides an additional and tasty option for TrueBlue members to earn loyalty points.â</p>
