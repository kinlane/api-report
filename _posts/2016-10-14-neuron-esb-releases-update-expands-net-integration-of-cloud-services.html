<p id="continue-jump">"We're very excited about this update from Neuron ESB," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Brett Raven</span>, Chief Technology Officer for&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Australia</span>-based ecommerce company, Lux Group. "We depend on Neuron ESB to manage each and every backend transaction for our company. We are eager to get our hands on the new powerful functionality and host of new features that CU4 brings to the platform."</p>
<p>The CU4 feature pack enables users to better capitalize on emerging cloud applications, building on Neuron ESB's proven time-to-market advantage using the Microsoft .NET Platform. Users have an intuitive framework on which to build their own connectors, in addition to a comprehensive slate of pre-built connectors for most commodity transports, queuing technologies, databases and on premise/cloud applications.</p>
<p>"By delivering a richer, more complete set of features, enhancements and connectors with every release, Neuron ESB enables even faster deployment of cloud tools and services, streamlines integration and reduces development resources. Development teams are more productive, building secure end-user solutions quickly and easily by capitalizing most effectively on their internal .NET capabilities," said Marty Wasznicky, Vice President, Neuron ESB.</p>
<p>In addition to workflow enhancements, the CU4 release also introduces a number of new JSON/Swagger-enabled features to augment existing API management support. CU4's new repositories and access methods make using APIs easier and useful for organizations incorporating a greater number of REST (HTTP)-based services. OAuth integration has been added to easily authorize web service calls using Neuron ESB's Service Broker and supported connectors (HTTP/REST service endpoints); supported authorization services include Amazon, Azure Active Directory/ADFS, Google, Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo! and more.</p>
<p>CU4 provides significant enhancements to Neuron ESB's Rabbit MQ transport, supporting SSL security protocols and increasing performance by three-fold while, while extending the reliability of Rabbit MQ's transactional model.</p>
<p>Through its comprehensive connector library and interoperable APIs, Neuron ESB enables users to embed a broad range of services and applications in their custom solutions. For instance, modernizing capabilities such as marketing through Marketo can include integrating services with ERP, ecommerce and CRM applications such as NetSuite, Salesforce and Dynamics CRM. Neuron ESB's Amazon Web Services (AWS) connector complements Neuron ESB's Azure Service Bus connector enabling easy integration with solutions in the cloud. Its Zuora connector allows commerce, billing and finance SaaS products to be built directly into the developer's own subscription-based services. Neuron ESB now interacts easily with iOS mobile devices, both sending receiving alerts and notifications via its connector for Apple Push Notifications and Twilio.</p>
