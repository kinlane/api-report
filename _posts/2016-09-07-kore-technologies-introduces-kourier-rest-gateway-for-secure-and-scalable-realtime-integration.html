<p><a href="ttp://www.koretech.com">Kore Technologies</a>, a leading provider of enterprise integration and eCommerce software announced the latest version of its award-winning enterprise integration and data management suite. Having successfully completed beta-testing over the last several months, Kourier Integrator Release 4.3 is now generally available and delivers new features that make it easier to create, deploy and use RESTful Web Services for real-time enterprise application integration.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Introduced in this release is the Kourier REST Gateway, a critical component of the real-time integration architecture. It&rsquo;s responsible for providing secure access to MultiValue applications from outside the firewall while it monitors, manages and measures REST Resource usage. Organizations deploying the REST Gateway can feel confident about offering access to their system from the outside world without worrying about a user consuming all of their system resources using Policies to limit (rate) the maximum number of requests per minute/hour/day for each Gateway user. An interactive dashboard offers visualization of REST API request trends and performance, giving administrators actionable data for making system adjustments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve not only made it easier for organizations to create and deploy REST integrations for their applications, the APIs are developer-friendly too,&rdquo; said, Mark Dobransky, co-founder and managing partner of Kore Technologies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Kourier&rsquo;s REST development framework has been enhanced to streamline and simplify how developers build real-time REST APIs. Developers will be more productive because they can focus on the application interface instead of low-level protocol details such as data validation, resource security and transaction logging. Creating REST Resources is done predominantly via configuration pages instead of programming. For more advanced requirements, developers can use Event Handlers to leverage existing application business logic or add special instructions at specific timing intervals. API consumers also benefit from using Kourier REST APIs because they are more developer-friendly. REST features such as pagination, field limiting, dynamic sorting and query wildcards can be utilized with no additional programming effort, reducing the time and cost required for application integration.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Release 4.3 also includes significant improvements to Kourier&rsquo;s support for additional data sources (e.g., Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL) with the new Quick Start Workbench and advanced data profiling system. Users can quickly create a near real-time Microsoft SQL Server data warehouse using the profiled data to generate export definitions and maintenance-free Microsoft SSIS packages.</p>
