<p class="responsiveNews">"Since advertising with Seller Suites, just over 3 months ago days ago, my Team has seen a significant improvement in both our volume of monthly seller leads and our contact and close ratio. Prior to using Social Sell, we averaged between 12-16 seller leads monthly. Within the first month of using Social Sell we doubled that number to 28 and in the last month we have brought in 39 seller leads. We noticed a bump ranging from 5-9 new seller leads monthly from the remarketing campaign with CINC as well,&rdquo; said CINC client, Brent Chapuis, Team Owner of Coastal Realty Group located in Biloxi, MS.</p>
