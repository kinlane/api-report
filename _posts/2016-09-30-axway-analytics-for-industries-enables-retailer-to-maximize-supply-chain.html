Important in today&rsquo;s digital economy, the initiative enables each local store to optimize service levels, manage orders, and improve customer experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ensuring the on-time delivery to Monoprix stores is key to our goal of providing exceptional customer service, but it also puts a tremendous pressure on our operations teams,&rdquo; said J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Simon, implementation team manager at Monoprix. &ldquo;Axway Decision Insight monitors an average of 200, 000 orders &ndash; a value of several million euros per day across all stores.
