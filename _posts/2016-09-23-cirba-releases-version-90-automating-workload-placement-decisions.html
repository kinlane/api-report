<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/cirba_landscape_logo_lime_rgb.jpg" alt="" width="30%" align="right" /><a href="http://www.cirba.com/">Cirba Inc.</a>, the leading provider of software-defined infrastructure control analytics, released Cirba version 9.0 featuring VM routing decisions for hybrid cloud environments that include&nbsp;Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Azure&trade;,&nbsp;Amazon Web Services&nbsp;(AWS) and IBM<sup>&reg;</sup>SoftLayer<sup>&reg;</sup>. This new capability is available through Cirba&rsquo;s Reservation Console which is currently leveraged by Fortune 500 organizations to govern and automate VM placement decisions within their internal environments, including VMware<sup>&reg;</sup>, OpenStack, Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Hyper-V<sup>&reg;</sup>, IBM<sup>&reg;</sup>PowerVM<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;on AIX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;and Red Hat<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Enterprise Virtualization platforms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The decision of which workloads should go into public cloud, and which public cloud platform is best for that workload, shouldn&rsquo;t be based on opinions and best guesses,&rdquo; said Andrew Hillier, co-founder and CTO of Cirba. &ldquo;Cirba brings science to this critical decision process and now provides real-time routing analytics for hybrid cloud that analyzes detailed application requirements against the capabilities of public cloud hosting environments, including their security, compliance, configuration and performance characteristics. This ensures that the best hosting environment is chosen for each workload, and enables highly agile automation strategies that still follow an enterprise-class governance process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cirba automatically determines the best hosting environment for applications by simultaneously assessing compute, storage and network requirements, security considerations, compliance requirements, software licensing requirements, business&nbsp;rules&nbsp;and other operational policies. By assessing both public clouds and internal environments,&nbsp;Cirba&nbsp;allows organizations to manage their hybrid hosting risk and eliminates the challenge and manual effort of trying to determine which workloads are suitable for the public cloud. Cirba&rsquo;s web services API integrates with cloud management platforms, such as OpenStack and VMware<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;vRealize<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Automation, to enable fully-automated workflows that are completely transparent to end users.</p>
<p>Once workloads are running in the cloud,&nbsp;Cirba&nbsp;also provides centralized visibility and hybrid optimization analysis that spans both on and off-premise workloads. Whether workloads are hosted in Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Azure&trade;, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and IBM&reg; SoftLayer<sup>&reg;&nbsp;</sup>or internally on VMware<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;vCenter<sup>&reg;</sup>, OpenStack, Microsoft<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Hyper-V<sup>&reg;</sup>, IBM<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;PowerVM<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;on AIX<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;and Red Hat<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;Enterprise Virtualization-based, Cirba ensures they are in the right place and properly resourced to reduce risk and minimize costs.</p>
