<p><a href="https://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a>, a leader in software quality tools for the connected world, released <a href="https://swaggerhub.com/">SwaggerHub</a> integrations for Amazon Web Services (AWS). Now within the SwaggerHub SaaS application, API designers can instantly deploy their Swagger/Open API Definitions directly to Amazon API Gateway, a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale. SwaggerHub is the place for development teams to collaborate and coordinate the entire lifecycle of an API.</p>
<p>âGoing from Swagger to a serverless infrastructure has typically required a number of complicated steps across many different configuration interfaces,â said Tony Tam, VP of Products, Swagger at SmartBear. âWith our new integration, we not only can push the definition to the Amazon API Gateway, but make the connection to AWS Lambda 100 percent automated. Now, developers can let AWS take care of the entire serverless infrastructure while they focus on the business value of their services.â</p>
<p>Serverless deployments, or âno-ops,â is considered by many to be the next stage in the evolution of cloud computing. By removing the entire server infrastructure, developers can rely on their cloud provider to manage and scale their APIs automatically. For APIs specifically, serverless requires a mapping between an API description and business logic, a task perfectly suited for the Swagger/Open API Specification.</p>
<p>âAWS customers are increasingly deploying serverless applications using Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda to eliminate the need for hands-on management of their infrastructure and realize faster times to market,â said Tim Wagner, General Manager of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway at Amazon Web Services, Inc. âThe new SwaggerHub integration makes it easy for developers to build and deploy serverless infrastructures that automatically scale to meet demand, from a few requests per second to hundreds of thousands, without paying for idle resources.â</p>
<p>The SwaggerHub integration with AWS automatically maps operations from the Swagger Definition directly to AWS Lambda functions and creates them if they do not exist. With SwaggerHub, the barrier to moving to a serverless deployment is near zero and the definition in SwaggerHub is treated as the single source of truth for the API deployment, reducing errors and promoting a cohesive API lifecycle.</p>
