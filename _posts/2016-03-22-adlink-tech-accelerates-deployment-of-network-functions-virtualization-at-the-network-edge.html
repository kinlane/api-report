<p><a href="http://www.adlinktech.com">ADLINK Technology</a>, a leading global provider of Application Ready Intelligent Platforms (ARiPs) and compute building blocks that enable the Internet of Things (IoT), today announced a pre-integrated network functions virtualization (NFV) platform designed to enable telecom equipment manufacturers (TEMS) and communications service providers (CSPs) to accelerate production of NFV deployments. The ADLINK NFV solution features Wind River&reg; Titanium Server&trade;, the industry's first fully integrated and feature-complete NFV infrastructure software platform, available on ADLINK&rsquo;s SETO-1000 extreme outdoor server and Modular Industrial Cloud Architecture (MICA) platform. The complete NFV infrastructure offering is designed to deliver optimized media processing and communications for today&rsquo;s bandwidth-intensive applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The ADLINK NFV solution offers optimized software stacks and a mesh topology for maximum throughput and redundancy. All carrier-grade hardware is offered as part of a modular delivery system with an open/closed NFV solution architecture that enables TEMs and CSPs to easily customize functionality based on application requirements without compromising security or increasing time-to-deployment. In addition, the NFV solution ensures system compatibility and future-proofing with APIs based on open source and de facto open standards. Target virtualization applications include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Mobile Edge Computing (MEC)</li>
<li> Customer premises equipment (CPE) </li>
<li> Radio access networks (RAN) </li>
<li> Deep packet inspection (DPI) </li>
<li> Broadband remote access server (BRAS) </li>
<li> Content delivery networks (CDN) </li>
<li> Media processing</li>
<li> Policy management</li>
<li> Security</li>
<li> LTE Core</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;As part of our Wind River Titanium Cloud ecosystem, ADLINK has worked closely with us to validate and offer their NFV solution pre-integrated with Wind River Titanium Server software,&rdquo; said Charlie Ashton, senior director of business development for networking solutions at Wind River. &ldquo;By integrating Titanium Server with ADLINK&rsquo;s rugged hardware platforms, NFV can be achieved at the network edge or in the data center, providing users with greater opportunities to maximize the performance and capacity of their NFV implementation and reduce operating expenses. With Titanium Server as a software foundation, the industry can accelerate their NFV goals while ensuring carrier grade uptime and strict reliability mandated by telecom networks.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our carrier grade COTS solution allows TEMs and CSPs to accelerate time-to-market on their virtualization applications, removing the need to integrate, test, and provide support for multiple technology components from different vendors and open source,&rdquo; said Yong Luo, general manager of ADLINK&rsquo;s Embedded Computing Product Segment. &ldquo;With a ready-to-use platform, customers can focus their development activities on revenue-generating applications instead of the building blocks required for complex networking and communications solutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ADLINK&rsquo;s SETO-1000 is the first high-performance MEC platform specifically designed for extreme environments and outdoor telecom/networking applications. Based on the dual Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; E5-2400 v2 family of processors, the SETO-1000 MEC platform enables delivery of data center performance at the edge of the network. The SETO-1000 provides IT and cloud-computing capabilities within the Radio Access Network (RAN) in close proximity to mobile subscribers, offering a service environment characterized by proximity, ultra-low latency, and high-bandwidth that allows content, services, and applications to be accelerated, maintaining a customer&rsquo;s high-level Quality of Experience (QoE).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ADLINK&rsquo;s MICA platform is an Application Ready Intelligent Platform (ARiP) for industrial cloud computing that adopts an innovative modular design for upgraded scalability and flexibility. Customers can choose from different functional modules (compute, switch, storage, and IO modules) depending on their specific application requirements to build a highly tailored computing platform. The hybrid design allows customers to mix and match between 1/4 and 1/2-width slot compute nodes in order to scale the number of independent systems with different processing capacities in the platform, as needed.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">NFV solutions that are pre-validated with Wind River Titanium Server must feature Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; processors and at least 500 GB of storage and 15 GB of RAM, support network interface controllers (NICs) with 1, 10, and 40 GB DPDK-enabled ports, and are recommended to have two cores for OS and virtual switching.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Titanium Server is a carrier grade NFV infrastructure software solution that is designed to meet the stringent "always on" requirements of the telecom industry. Based on open standards including carrier grade Wind River Linux, real-time Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM), OpenStack&reg;, and Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK), while incorporating optimizations for Intel&reg; architecture, Titanium Server delivers high performance and carrier-grade reliability.
