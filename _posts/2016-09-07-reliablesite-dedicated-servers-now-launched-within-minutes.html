<p>A <a href="http://www.reliablesite.net/">ReliableSite</a> dedicated server can now be in a customer's control within 10 minutes, with a new rapid deploy system from the hosting company.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Using automation technology developed in-house, ReliableSite is offering pre-configured dedicated servers that will be available to customers with the requested operating system loaded. The rapid deploy servers will be sold in popular configurations, ranging from Quad Core to 44 Core servers. The servers are marked as having a 10 minute setup time, instead of the regular time. The availability of rapid deploy servers relies on ReliableSite&rsquo;s automation technology, which was first announced in March 2016. This feature is still available for customers who choose to custom configure their dedicated servers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Speed is essential to dedicated hosting, and the time it takes for a customer to receive their server is no exception,&rdquo; said Radic Davydov, CEO and founder of ReliableSite.Net. &ldquo;Our earlier automation project was intended to be a stepping stone to rapid deploy servers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ReliableSite&rsquo;s rapid deploy servers are part of a larger effort to make bare metal servers as easy to deploy as virtual cloud without the limitations of a shared virtual environment. This means that its dedicated servers include features such as a native hosting API, auto-operating system installer, and built-in scanners for hardware health and security vulnerabilities. The company also offers DDoS protection standard with every server.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Since 2006, ReliableSite has grown to provide unmanaged, enterprise-grade dedicated servers and fully-managed dedicated hosting in the New York City metro area and Miami, FL. The company offers 100% uptime SLAs and support staff who are on-site 24 hours a day.</p>
