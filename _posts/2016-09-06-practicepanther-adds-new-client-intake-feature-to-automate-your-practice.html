<p><a href="http://www.PracticePanther.com">PracticePanther</a>, one of the fastest growing legal case management software companies, has removed the &ldquo;entry&rdquo; from &ldquo;data entry&rdquo; with their brand new feature, Intake Forms. Law firms can now save time inputting their clients&rsquo; information into the software. By sending their clients secure forms to fill out, the information goes directly into the software, removing the need for manual entry.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Attorneys and paralegals have been wasting a lot of time manually entering their clients&rsquo; information into the computer," said David Bitton, CEO of PracticePanther. We're automating that process. Law firms can now hand their clients an iPad, instead of a notepad, to fill out their personal information. Instead of trying to decipher their handwriting, the form on the iPad will automatically create a new contact in PracticePanther, saving the law firm countless hours each month." Every form is also mobile friendly and responsive to work on any device.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">PracticePanther is one of the only systems to provide unlimited intake forms as well as unlimited fields per form. These forms are built directly into the software, meaning no costly integrations with third party software is needed. Using the built-in form builder, anyone in the firm can create, edit, view, and delete the forms themselves.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To save law firms as much time as possible, they can now embed the forms directly onto their website. When a new form is filled, a new contact and matter is automatically created in PracticePanther. The attorney or paralegal will also receive an email and task notifying them.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Once the form is submitted, law firms can generate entire documents with their clients&rsquo; information, like contracts and retainer agreements, saving even more time.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We expected intake forms would help a large number of our members,&rdquo; said PracticePanther CTO, Ori Tamuz. &ldquo;What we didn&rsquo;t expect was the sheer amount of emails thanking us for revolutionizing their firm&rsquo;s workflow. The best part is, they didn&rsquo;t need to upgrade or spend any more money.&rdquo; Much like the rest of PracticePanther&rsquo;s long feature list, intake forms are available to all its members free of charge.</p>
