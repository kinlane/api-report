<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/brother_fluke.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /><a href="/admin/news/http:/www.brothermobilesolutions.com">Brother Mobile Solutions, Inc.</a> (BMS) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brother International Corporation and premier provider of mobile and desktop printing solutions, is pleased to announce its recently formed relationship with Fluke Networks, the world&rsquo;s leading provider of tools for the certification, troubleshooting, and installation of network cabling.</p>
<p>Brother has licensed Fluke Networks&rsquo; LinkWare&trade; Live API to create LabelLink&trade;, the first mobile app and back end solution designed to dramatically streamline the network and cable labeling process.</p>
<p><strong>Leveraging the Cloud for Advanced Cable Labeling &amp; Testing</strong></p>
<p>Built on Fluke Networks&rsquo; LinkWare&trade; Live platform, the new solution leverages the latest developments in cabling certification testing technology and advanced mobile printing capabilities to deliver unprecedented speed, efficiency and accuracy to the cable ID and labeling process &ndash; a discipline which continues to grow in scope, complexity and urgency as data centers evolve. Electrical construction and engineering contractors can now meet multiple project needs for cable ID by inputting data only once.</p>
<p>According to David Crist, President of Brother Mobile Solutions, &ldquo;This solution was created by two great brands combining their technologies to make network wire, cable and component testing and labeling faster and easier than ever before. It&rsquo;s a real game-changer, especially for contractors engaged in standards-based labeling of large and complex datacom installations. Our Brother Mobile team is thrilled and excited to work with Fluke Networks to introduce the LabelLink application to the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric Conley, VP and General Manager of Fluke Networks, adds: &ldquo;LinkWare Live bridges the gap between the project manager&rsquo;s office where the data for testing cables and printing labels originates, and the jobsite where Fluke Networks Testers and Brother labeling tools are used by the installation crew. For network designers, integrators and contractors, the combination of Versiv, LinkWare Live, and the LabelLink app automates multiple workflow processes and will help eliminate a major pain point in jobsite productivity. More importantly, it ensures labeling accuracy across the entire project.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>A Snapshot of the New Solution in Action</strong></p>
<p>Interested parties can learn more or preview the solution in a video by Brother and Fluke Networks at www.BrotherLabelLink.com.</p>
<p>Here is a snapshot of how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">In the office, the systems designer uses CAD to plan the network infrastructure, and then uploads cable ID and component identifiers to LinkWare Live, Fluke Networks Cabling Certification tester and report management application.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Contractor downloads and installs free LabelLink app.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">On the jobsite, the contractor or technician downloads the identifiers from LinkWare Live through a smart phone into a Brother P-touch EDGE&reg; PT-E550W industrial labeling tool, which is used to create and print high-quality, standards-compliant laminated labels.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">On the jobsite, the contractor or technician also downloads the same identifiers into the Fluke Networks Versiv&trade; Cabling Certification System, performs the tests, and uploads testing results for each identifier using LinkWare Live.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, this means that the cable identifiers and test results for each project can be stored in one place and can be retrieved and used as many times as needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping track of cable identifiers across multiple databases for testers and printers wastes time and cuts into our profitability,&rdquo; said CJ Santeford, operations manager of PowerCom, a Bothell, Washington-based installer of communications infrastructure. &ldquo;Brother&rsquo;s LabelLink app combined with LinkWare Live gives us the ability to use a single database for managing this important task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duane Yamashita, Sr. Product Manager for Brother P-touch EDGE industrial labeling brand, notes: &ldquo;Brother created an app for our EDGE label printer that interacts seamlessly with the cloud ID data file, so installation workers can instantly access the relevant cable identifiers and create and print labels without the need for additional data entry. This not only ensures accuracy and consistency of the network labeling scheme as designed and built, but also provides the foundation for an effective cable management program going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Brother P-touch EDGE PT-E550W is a compact, full-featured industrial labeling tool featuring wireless connectivity for transferring data and printing directly from mobile devices. Designed by industry professionals for industry professionals, it can print wider labels (up to 24mm wide) â including heat shrink tube â and is ideal for labeling large, complex IT network projects. The ruggedly-built PT-E550W combines powerful technology with advanced features and intuitive operation that make the labeling job faster, simpler and more efficient for the installation crew, without the need to read a manual or undergo extensive training.</p>
