<p><a href="http://www.LiveRamp.com">LiveRamp</a>, an Acxiom&reg; company, today announced a new integration with Facebook that allows clients to connect Facebook advertising campaigns with offline sales transactions taking place in stores, branch offices, contact centers, and other brick-and-mortar locations.</p>
<p>Building on existing capabilities to onboard offline first- and third-party data for targeting through Facebook Custom Audiences, LiveRamp can now enable clients to securely onboard their sales transaction data and perform closed-loop measurement analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By connecting campaign exposure data to offline sales transactions, marketers can understand which campaign strategies are truly generating real business returns,&rdquo; said Travis May, president and general manager of LiveRamp. &ldquo;This insight is key to optimizing campaign performance and justifying higher digital marketing budgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The enhanced integration makes it safe and easy for LiveRamp clients to activate their sales transaction data within Facebook. After LiveRamp onboards data through the Facebook Offline Conversions API, Facebook provides clients with a campaign measurement report that shows the relationship between advertising exposures and offline purchases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to be one of the first to market with this new capability,&rdquo; said Anneka Gupta, chief product officer at LiveRamp. &ldquo;Developing high-quality partner integrations is one of our top priorities.&rdquo;</p>
