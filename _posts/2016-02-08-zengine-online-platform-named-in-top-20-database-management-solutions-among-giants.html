<p>We are proud to announce that <a href="http://www.wizehive.com/zengine/">WizeHive&rsquo;s Zengine</a> shares a top spot on an esteemed industry list next to industry giants Oracle, IBM, SAP, HP, and Amazon. Capterra, a Gartner, Inc. company, has quickly become a website destination for searching, ranking and reviewing cloud-based software products.  Capterra recently released a list of the Top 20 Most Popular Database Management Software and names Zengine, released in 2014, as a most popular online database platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Zengine provides a simple and efficient way for business users and citizen developers to build custom forms, reports, dashboards and manage tasks, notifications and more.  Customers are typically business managers (non-technical) who use Zengine as a CRM and as a business process management (BPM) tool to manage inbound sales activity, customer relationships, outbound/inbound communication, team collaboration, grants and scholarship lifecycle management, and other operational priorities.  In addition, Zengine is being used by hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics to manage and track patient activity within the HIPAA-compliant version of the Zengine online database management software.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to CEO/Co-founder, Michael Levinson, &ldquo;The ROI of the platform comes from significant time savings, increased collaboration, improved data integrity and more efficient workflows. From the planning team who used Zengine to manage ticketing and 250,000+ seat assignments for the Pope&rsquo;s visit to Philadelphia to the judges who now use Zengine to capture thousands of voting results at Techweek&rsquo;s national conferences, clients of Zengine are calling the platform &lsquo;a Godsend!&rsquo; (Options for College, Inc).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For more complex projects, Zengine provides a suite of tools for developers to easily extend the functionality of Zengine. They can quickly create systems with custom functionality, third-party integrations and powerful workflows.  A restful, open-API along with webhooks makes it easy to exchange data with third-party systems.   A recent partnership with Zapier has made it equally easy for Zengine customers to integrate out of the box with over 350 products including Gmail, HelpScout, Quickbooks, MailChimp, Slack and more.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition, a proprietary powerful plugin system based on Javascript, HTML and CSS, makes it simple to add more tools onto the system by adding custom workflows, personalized visual dashboards, Gantt charts, resource scheduling and more.  A server-side scripting language built on top of Amazon&rsquo;s AWS Lambda platform allows developers to upload and initiate reliable server-based processes.</p>
