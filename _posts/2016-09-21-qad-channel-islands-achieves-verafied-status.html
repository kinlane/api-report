<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/large_qad_logo_tagline.jpg" alt="" width="40%" align="right" />QAD Inc. (Nasdaq:QADA) (Nasdaq:QADB) a leading provider of enterprise business software and services for global manufacturing companies, today announced that the security layer of the QAD Channel Islands user experience has earned the VerAfied status from Veracode. The newly achieved status underscores QAD&rsquo;s commitment to developing secure solutions.</p>
<p>The VerAfied status from Veracode signifies that QAD provides customers a high level of software assurance and security verification. Software earning VerAfied status must employ security measures that meet or exceed industry standards for security, reliability and compliance. The assessment of the QAD Channel Islands&rsquo; security layer used a variety of Veracode&rsquo;s testing methodologies. The VerAfied status includes an independent review of all findings in order to ensure QAD&rsquo;s software has met this strict standard for security.</p>
<p>QAD Channel Islands offers a user experience to help manufacturers make better decisions and streamline transactions. Currently available to early adopters, the first phase of Channel Islands, called Anacapa, was introduced in 2015 and the second phase, called Santa Cruz, was introduced at QAD Explore 2016 in Chicago. One of the key Channel Islands&rsquo; goals is to make using QAD Cloud ERP simple and intuitive for the first time user while supporting the more flexible needs of advanced users that cross several roles. Channel Islands uses a Restful API based architecture to make it straightforward to adapt to currently popular user interface technology like HTML5 and to future-proof the user experience as new user interface technologies come to market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is crucial that our customers know that their information is secure,&rdquo; said QAD Chief Technology Officer Tony Winter. &ldquo;We included security in the Channel Islands development lifecycle from the beginning. So when a prospective customer says, &lsquo;Are you following best practices?&rsquo; we can show them that we are. Earning the VerAfied mark lets our customers know that we have done our due diligence to achieve a high level of security.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are finding that CIOs and CSOs are asking their purchasing teams to take security into consideration when procuring new applications. For this reason, it is important that software vendors find a way to demonstrate that their software is built using secure development practices,&rdquo; said Chris Wysopal, CTO and CISO, Veracode. &ldquo;The VerAfied mark tells the world that QAD is assessing for application vulnerabilities and complying with industry standards, but more importantly, it lets their customers know that QAD is a vendor they can trust to keep their data secure.&rdquo;</p>
