With pre-built Twitter dashboards, users can begin analysis within a few clicks, customize their analytics experience by building their own reports, and even incorporate existing business data.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For details on Yellowfinâs Twitter Connector, simply visit the Yellowfin Marketplace: <a href="http://www.yellowfinbi.com/YFWebsite-Marketplace-77991">http://www.yellowfinbi.com/YFWebsite-Marketplace-77991 </a></p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âYellowfinâs Twitter Connector empowers users to easily analyze their own, as well as competitor Twitter data, via intuitive visualizations and dashboards,â said Yellowfin Global Marketing Director, Daniel Shaw-Dennis. âNot only can users perform more comprehensive competition analysis by monitoring attributes like brand mentions and hashtags, they can also improve their own engagement strategies, or assess how larger campaigns drove online conversations.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Yellowfinâs Twitter Connector lets users analyze and directly compare key performance metrics, such as tweet and engagement frequency over time, as well as conduct in-depth content analysis to ascertain the successful elements of a tweet, including word count, character and image inclusions and even mentions. Whatâs more, the connector enables users to gain insight about which influencers had reached out to them and when.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âSocial Media Intelligence [SMI] is quickly becoming a buzzword in the spheres of market research and BI,â said Shaw-Dennis. âBusinesses use SMI to listen to social media and can gain insights.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWith Yellowfinâs Twitter Connector we realized that social media listening was important, but we also wanted to enable users to combine Twitter data with existing internal business data to deliver greater insights,â said Shaw-Dennis. âBy adding social media data to existing data, it is possible to identify new campaign related trends and opportunities.âÂ Â Â Â </p>

Yellowfinâs analysis found Trumpâs self-promotion on Twitter was much higher than Clintonâs, mentioning his own Twitter handle three times more often than Hillary.
