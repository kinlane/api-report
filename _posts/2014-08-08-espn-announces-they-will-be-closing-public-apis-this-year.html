<p>After a little over two years in operation, <a href="http://developer.espn.com/blog/read/publicretirement">ESPN has said that they will not longer be accepting registrations for public API keys</a>, and will be discontinuing all of their public APIs.</p>
<p>The ESPN public API has included access to headlines, athletes, teams, research, medals, scores, schedules, audio, video, photo, calendar, and a handful of other resources for the last two years.</p>
<p>The public API provided pretty clear guidance on developer <a href="http://developer.espn.com/terms">terms of service</a>, as well as <a href="http://developer.espn.com/branding">branding guidelines</a> dictating how developers can display resources obtained via the API.</p>
<p>The deprecation of the public ESPN APIs follow the lead of other big media industry APIs like the Netflix public API, which also <a href="http://developer.netflix.com/blog/read/Retiring_the_Netflix_Public_API">closed down this year.</a></p>
