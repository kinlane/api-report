<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/screen_shot_2016_10_07_at_12.09.29_am.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.blazemeter.com">BlazeMeter</a>, the leader in open source-based continuous performance testing, today released a number of key contributions to the JMeter community, helping to advance JMeter from a scripting and load generation tool to a more complete environment where practitioners can develop, debug and execute tests.</p>
<p>Leading the list is the BlazeMeter Step-by-Step Debugger, which simplifies and expedites script development in JMeter 3.0 by allowing testers to debug scripts step-by-step and receive updates in real time. Testers can also skip over the step-by-step approach by setting breakpoints and running scripts until that breakpoint is reached. Now JMeter users can easily pinpoint precisely where the components are executed, understand how JMeter scoping works and, for the first time ever, view the execution order of the test plan. The debugger provides testers with a professional-grade tool to speed design and troubleshooting of sophisticated tests. A detailed guide on how to install and use the debugger is available on the BlazeMeter blog.</p>
<p>Additionally, a new Keyboard Shortcuts feature dramatically speeds scripting with an entirely new way to drop components into the test plan. Instead of manually inspecting menus to find components, JMeter users can select the command key with another predefined key, enabling them to build entire test plans with a series of keystrokes. As a core JMeter feature, Keyboard Shortcuts is available to all users by default when they install JMeter 3.0. For a demo of this and other helpful new features in JMeter 3.0, view our recent webcast: What's New in JMeter 3.0 and Q&A.</p>
<p>BlazeMeterâs Chief Scientist Andrey Pokhilko also released the Plugins Manager --- a faster and easier way to work with JMeter Plugins. Historically, installing and removing plugins by downloading file bundles was a complex and manual process that often resulted in menus cluttered with extra plugins. The Plugins Manager eliminates these issues by enabling JMeter users to install and remove plugins through one simple user interface.</p>
<p>âWeâre always looking to develop new features that support the core JMeter community,â said Pokhilko. âWeâve heard from developers that several common functionalities could be improved, so we worked on capabilities that make for an easier and more productive experience with JMeter.â</p>
<p>âThe BlazeMeter Step-by-Step Debugger adds professional-grade power to test development and speeds onboarding of developers and seasoned test practitioners to JMeter,â said Dave Karow, Director of Product Marketing at BlazeMeter. âAndreyâs Plugins Manager reduces complexity and the Keyboard Shortcut feature enables power users to create test plans in the blink of an eye. These features come directly from our engagement with hundreds of enterprise customers who want to move faster and more confidently with JMeter as they distribute responsibility for performance testing out to agile teams, closer to where development occurs.â</p>
<p>BlazeMeterâs open source initiatives extend beyond the scope of its JMeter contributions. The company continues to support and enhance the open source project Taurus, which offers an automation friendly framework for continuous testing using JMeter and other leading open source tools.</p>
<p>At Velocity Santa Clara 2016, Pokhilko will reveal how Taurus can bring load testing up a level by adding a consistent layer of automation and a wider scope of functionality to existing open source tools. Specifically, he will be presenting âTake Your Load Testing Up a Notch With Open Source Toolsâ at 2:10 p.m. on Thursday, June 23. For more details, click on the link here.</p>
