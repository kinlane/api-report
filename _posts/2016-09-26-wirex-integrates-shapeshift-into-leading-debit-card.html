Todayâs integration means Wirex users can fund their cards with Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin and dozens of other leading blockchain assets instantly.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Wirex, which is known for offering a suite of personal banking solutions for Bitcoin users, initially released their Bitcoin debit card to enable every-day purchases from coffee to groceries or even the withdraw of funds from an ATM. Through its new integration with the ShapeShift API, Wirex customers can now fund their debit card with dozens of leading digital currencies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âBitcoin enjoys first-mover advantage and dominates the crypto market. However, as the ecosystem matures, there is also a growing community of users with other digital assets,â says Wirex Co-Founder Pavel Matveev. âOne of the most popular customer requests was to make a multi-asset-friendly debit card and with ShapeShift integration we have finally made this possible.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Beyond the debit card, Wirex also provides users with additional payment processing solutions including an account that enables users to pay with both cryptocurrencies and traditional currencies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Wirex renders banks wholly unnecessary. With cryptocurrency and an easy mobile app, one can avoid banks and still pay for things anywhere,â said ShapeShift Founder and CEO, Erik Voorhees. âWe are thrilled to have their services integrated with our API to expand their customerâs funding options.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Wirex App can be registered and downloaded in minutes and users receive a free virtual card that they can instantly load with Bitcoin or any ShapeShift-supported asset including Ethereum. See quick demo video: https://youtu.be/ydxh3bH-D4I</p>
