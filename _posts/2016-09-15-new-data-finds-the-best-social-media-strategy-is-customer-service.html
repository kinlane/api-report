For years, brands have been using social as a promotional mechanism, currently pumping out 23 messages for every 1 response given to a consumer â and their customers are fed up. New research from Sprout Social displays the ever-widening gap between what customers expect and what brands deliver on social.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The newest Sprout Social Index reveals that a majority of people expect to hear back from a brand within four hours of sending a message; in reality, people wait an average of 10 hours before receiving a response. Even worse, the data found that while consumers send 18 percent more social messages to brands than they did last year, nine in 10 of those messages go unanswered.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Now, consumers are biting back. In fact, 36 percent of people will publicly shame a company that ignores them on social, while a quarter are less likely to use a brandâs product or service.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âFor years, Sprout has been talking about the importance of social engagement, and this study underscores its effect on a brand's bottom line,â said Scott Brandt, CMO of Sprout Social. âThere is a clear disparity between what people want and what most brands are providing on social. Unless brands start closing that gap and meeting consumer expectations, people will take their loyalty and money elsewhere.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For its Q2 2016 Index, Sprout surveyed 1,000 individuals with Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts and collected metrics on the social interactions of 15 key industries, observing the disconnect between brand behavior and customer demands. The data reveals that if brands do meet customer expectations, they could turn the situation around. A few key takeaways include:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  - 90 percent of people have used social in some way to communicate directly with a brand. <br />Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  - Brands respond to only 11 percent of consumer messages, yet theyâre sending 23 promotional messages for every one response given to their audience. <br />Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  - Three in four people have had a negative interaction with a brand on social media, but 75 percent say theyâre likely to share a positive experience on their personal profile. <br />Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  - 14 percent of people are less likely to post negative things about a brand or service if a company responds on social. <br />Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  - 42 percent of people are more likely to use a brandâs product or service, and more than a third have more brand loyalty if they get a response.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>About the Data </strong><br />The Sprout Social Index is a report compiled and released by Sprout Social. All referenced data is based on 247,000 public social profiles (93,000 Facebook; 114,000 Twitter; 40,000 Instagram) of continually active accounts between Q1 2015 and Q1 2016. More than 2.9 billion messages sent and received during that time were analyzed for the purposes of this report. Some data may have shifted from the last Sprout Social Index report due to a shift in the social profiles analyzed; however, all overarching trends remain consistent. Industry classifications were based on LinkedIn industry categories. In some cases, closely related industries were merged into a single overarching industry. All messages analyzed that were considered casual mentions or not in need of a response were excluded from engagement, response rate and response time calculations with the intention of eliminating noise. Analysis of which messages required attention was done using Sproutâs proprietary technologies. Response time and response rate calculations were done using Sproutâs Engagement Reporting technology found in the Sprout Social product.</p>
