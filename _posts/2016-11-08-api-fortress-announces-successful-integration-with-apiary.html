<p><h1>API FORTRESS ANNOUNCES SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION WITH APIARY</h1></p>


<p><i>Partnership Integrates API Fortress Monitoring and Testing
with Apiary’s API-First Design Platform</i></p>


<p>San Francisco, CA - November 8, 2016 - API Fortress, a leading provider of API monitoring and test solutions, and Apiary, the leader in API-First design platforms, today announced new integration capabilities. The joint functionality provides mutual customers with the ability to complete the entire API development lifecycle by allowing API design contracts to automatically create scenarios to be used in test-driven development.</p>
