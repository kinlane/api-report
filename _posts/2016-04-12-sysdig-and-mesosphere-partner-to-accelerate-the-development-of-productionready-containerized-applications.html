<p>Today, <a href="http://www.sysdig.org">Sysdig</a> and <a href="https://mesosphere.com/">Mesosphere</a> announced a new partnership to provide enterprises with more robust solutions to develop, deliver, and monitor next-generation applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Microservices and containerization represent the next great platform shift for software developers in the enterprise,&rdquo; said Loris Degioanni, CEO and founder of Sysdig. &ldquo;While containers deliver efficiency and agility for developers, they introduce additional complexity for monitoring, troubleshooting, and operating production environments. We&rsquo;re pleased to partner with Mesosphere to overcome these challenges.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Technical integration across both open source and commercial products</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Both open source sysdig as well as Sysdig Cloud, the commercial solution for container-native monitoring, now support the Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DCOS), as well as the open source Apache Mesos and Marathon technologies."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With these new integrations, Sysdig automatically leverages metadata provided by Mesosphere&rsquo;s offerings to monitor and troubleshoot not only customers&rsquo; physical resources, but also logical groups that make up distributed applications and microservices.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Using this functionality, DevOps and sysadmins can leverage open source sysdig to perform deep troubleshooting of individual hosts in Mesos environments for root cause analysis, performance analysis,system exploration, and security analysis.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sysdig Cloud, Sysdig&rsquo;s commercial offering, provides pre-built monitoring dashboards and templates to quickly analyze the performance of Mesos-specific frameworks, applications, groups, tasks and more, dramatically simplifying the task of monitoring and alerting in DCOS and Mesos environments. Sysdig Cloud scales this capability to tens of thousands of containers across any number of clouds.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;A key element of any new platform is a robust ecosystem of partners that complement its capabilities to meet customers&rsquo; needs,&rdquo; said Ben Hindman, Chief Architect and Founder of Mesosphere. &ldquo;The DCOS is poised to revolutionize the way enterprises run modern applications and think about their infrastructure, but customers always want the ability to see as much data as possible about their IT operations. Sysdig has created a sophisticated approach to providing monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting across container and micro-service environments, which makes it a great fit for the DCOS.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Go to Market Partnership</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sysdig and Mesosphere are also creating a joint go-to-market for enterprises of all sizes. The goal is to provide customers the most robust set of technology options as they retool their datacenter to support modern applications.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;As enterprises move to deliver applications and services in containers, they are not only looking for seamless technology integration among vendors, but also simplicity in acquiring and supporting these products. Sysdig is committed to working closely with Mesosphere to ensure this simplicity for our customers,&rdquo; Loris Degoianni noted.</p>
