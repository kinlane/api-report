<p><a href="http://www.scality.com">Scality</a>, the world leader in object storage, today announced at Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Discover the General Availability release of Version 6.0 of its Scality RING object-storage software, the first S3 compatible object storage with full Microsoft&reg; Active Directory (AD) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) support, enabling enterprise production deployments of S3-based applications. Object storage is the technology of choice for large scale public and private clouds because it is the optimal method for handling the ever-demanding scale and performance requirements of digital business while running on any standard, price-competitive x86 hardware. The Scality RING Version 6.0 has already been deployed and tested by beta customers, and is enterprise-ready now.</p>
<p>"According to IDC's Worldwide Software-Defined Storage (SDS) 2014-2019 Forecast, capacity deployed in support of object-based SDS amounted to 12 exabytes in 2015 and is expected to reach 67.4 exabytes in 2020 growing at 49.5% CAGR," said Amita Potnis, IDC Research Manager. "We believe that data growth and the challenge of managing it at petabyte scale, with the right balance of performance, compliance and cost, will continue to drive adoption of object-based SDS software, like Scality's, across large enterprises and service providers."</p>
<p>Deployments of object storage have been limited to date, due to the lack of a standard API and the lack of integration with existing IT single sign-on systems. With its Microsoft AD and AWS IAM compatible authentication and user management, Scality&rsquo;s new SAML 2.0 compliant S3 API solves both problems. It also gives complete freedom for enterprise to deploy on-premises, in public cloud, or hybrid cloud thanks to complete code level compatibility.</p>
<p>Scality RING Version 6.0 addresses key digital business needs by introducing:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">the first S3 compatible object storage with full Microsoft AD and AWS IAM support, with exceptional levels of performance, including single bucket read/write/list performance</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">the most scalable data compliance solution on the market with rich capabilities for storing files in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format (WORM), per SEC Rule 17a-4, enabling truly scalable compliant archives with optional service for migration from EMC&reg; Centera and NetApp&reg; Snaplock</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">enhanced file system support, including automatic failover</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">improved parallel and multi-user write performance to the same file system directories further enabling specific backup, and media and entertainment applications</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Scality RING's robust support of industry standard object storage APIs allows for seamless integration with Aspera Direct to Cloud storage transfer capability for high-speed transfer of large files and data sets, encryption over the wire and at rest, and secure access control via Aspera transfer products,&rdquo; said Michelle Munson, CEO and co-founder of Aspera. &ldquo;We are very excited about the combination of Aspera FASP and the hybrid cloud support of the Scality RING and the benefits it provides to our joint customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;HPE is committed to the idea economy and as far as storage goes, this includes a full portfolio of system based all-flash array, and software-defined offerings for hyper-converge and capacity storage. Scality&rsquo;s software-defined object and file storage is core to HPE&rsquo;s strategy for large capacity storage,&rdquo; said Manish Goel, Senior Vice President and General Manager for storage at HPE. &ldquo;With RING Version 6.0, Scality is addressing the needs we have heard from our customers, especially increased integration with their AAA infrastructure and the support for the S3 API.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole IT industry is going to be transformed by the economic transition to digital business and the technical disruption of cloud technologies. We are just at the beginning, perhaps one percent penetration of &lsquo;cloud&rsquo;. The winners will be those who can bring the benefits of the cloud to mission-critical enterprise workloads,&rdquo; said J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Lecat, CEO of Scality.</p>
