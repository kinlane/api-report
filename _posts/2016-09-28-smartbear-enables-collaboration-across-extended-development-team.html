<p><a href="http://smartbear.com">SmartBear Software</a>, the leader in software quality tools for the connected world, released a major revision of Collaborator, the leading dev collaboration tool that helps development, testing and management teams work together to produce high quality code, applications and services. Collaborator 10.0 introduces Community, Team and Enterprise editions to better serve software development teams of all sizes. Increased efficiency, time savings and improved knowledge transfer across the extended development team are what drive organizations to Collaborator. Full integration with Microsoft Visual Studio, IBM Rational Team Concert and the ability to review Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF files ensure quick and effective dev collaboration throughout the entire application lifecycle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This major release of Collaborator 10.0 delivers new functionality including full integration with Visual Studio, which makes review creation and participation very easy,&rdquo; said Justin Collier<span class="bwuline">,</span> Product Owner, Collaborator at SmartBear. &ldquo;This leads to higher review participation across development teams and ultimately more reliable and higher quality products. Additionally, the new Team edition extends SmartBear's award-winning peer code review to organizations that do not need all of the functionality of Collaborator's Enterprise edition. The Enterprise edition continues as the solution for companies that need flexible, scalable and customizable code and documentation team review. We are delighted that these new editions allow SmartBear to help even more organizations adopt efficient peer review practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collaborator 10.0 includes support for the preferred IDE for Windows, .NET and C# developers. With Collaborator&rsquo;s Visual Studio add-in, productivity increases because teams conduct peer review without leaving the IDE. In addition to Visual Studio and Microsoft Team Foundation Server support, Collaborator seamlessly integrates with more version control systems and IDEs than any other dev collaboration tool available today.
