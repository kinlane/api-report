Version 2.5 features a host of security enhancements, additional applications added to the secure mobile workspace, FIPS 140-2 certification, and certified integration with MobileIron MDM (Mobile Device Management) and other mobility management providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This newest build of SentinelSecureâ¢ is designed to address four main workflows for users accessing network file stores and applications from mobile sources:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Secure Communications</li>
<li>Secure File Management</li>
<li>Secure Internet/Intranet Access</li>
<li>Secure Location-based Services</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThis will be our fourth consecutive sponsorship of the CTIA Super Mobility conference and every year we capitalize on the opportunity to speak to users, decision makers, partners and the media about the direction our industry is going related to securing enterprise data from mobile points of intrusion,â said SyncDog CEO and Founder Jonas Gyllensvaan. âWe take this primary research and input from current customer requirements and we try to build the best mobile workspace available at a price point that makes sense. Weâve been hard at work since last September and believe version 2.5 accomplishes this and we are proud to share the experience with attendees at CTIA in Las Vegas.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A milestone in the SentinelSecureâ¢ journey in 2016 has been its recent validation from NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) which certified that SyncDogâs encryption engine within the container meets Federal Information Processing Standards or FIPS 140-2 requirements (Cert. #2687). In a remarkable seven-month certification window, SyncDog worked closely with technology partner SafeLogic, using SafeLogicâs CryptoComplyâ¢ drop-in FIPS 140-2 compliance module to reach the FIPS milestone. Based in Palo Alto, California, SafeLogic provides innovative encryption products for applications in mobile, server, appliance, wearable, and other constrained environments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>SyncDogâs Partner Strategy for Best-in-Class Mobility Management</strong><br />The past 12 months for SyncDog have been very healthy on the application integration side with the addition of several certified APIs for SentinelSecureâ¢ including:Â </p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>MobileIron EMM</li>
<li>Snow Software EMM</li>
<li>Notify Technology MDM, and</li>
<li>Apperian Mobile Application Management Platform</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe believe we have the most secure mobile application environment with the greatest functionality in the world, but understand it is not enough,â added Gyllensvaan. âWe thought if we could make available the SentinelSecureâ¢ container as both standalone and part of an EMM/MDM deployment with seamless integration, our customers would have the added benefit of choice.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SyncDog has packaged the SentinelSecureâ¢ containerized application workspace to include an industry-specific secure application build for Healthcare and a package specific to the U.S. Government with a Department of Defense build. Additional application functionality that rounds out SentinelSecureâ¢ version 2.5 includes:</p>

<li>A Personal Information Management (PIM) suite</li>
