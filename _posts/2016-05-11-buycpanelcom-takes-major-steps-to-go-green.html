<p>Representatives with <a href="http://buycpanel.com">BuycPanel</a> announced today that the company has officially gone paperless in its offices.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;This is a major step for us, a step that we&rsquo;re gladly taking in an effort to doing our part in helping protect the environment,&rdquo; said Jamison O&rsquo;Connell, customer service supervisor and spokesperson for BuycPanel. &ldquo;Going green gives us the opportunity to contribute towards sustaining our environment while making the world a better place for everyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">cPanel is a web-based client interface. It allows users to monitor things like disk space and bandwidth usage. cPanel also gives the client the ability to manage their own passwords, mail accounts, FTP accounts, sub domains, error pages, protected directories and files, MySQL databases, cron jobs, redirects, and more.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), electronic, paperless, and or recycled products use less energy to produce than items produced from raw materials because the energy costs associated with collecting the raw materials have been eliminated or reduced. It can therefore reduce pollution and help conserve the natural resources. When trees are not harvested for paper products, the carbon dioxide sequestered within the plant material is not released into the air.</p>
