<p>DMG Productions announced today that it will feature San Francisco based Karmic Labs, Inc., in an upcoming episode, airing first quarter 2016 via the Discovery Channel.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This segment will focus on Karmic Labs, a financial technology company changing the way companies spend money.  To pay for expenses, many companies currently ask employees to make a purchase and file for reimbursement or share a corporate card opening them up to fraud and abuse.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Karmic built a card with software that businesses can give to all.  The cards speak to an app where an administrator can control limits, approve real time fund transfers and track expenses remotely as the swipe captures information giving a company complete oversight and instant expense reporting that syncs to accounting software.  It eliminates the need for reimbursements or shared cards while giving a company more control of their finances.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We started with an idea there were better ways for organizations to think about the ways they manage and spend company funds.  We also saw the need for a better way for applications to interact with the payment and card layer and we wanted to improve that aspect,&rdquo; said Ryan Weidenmiller, CEO of Karmic Labs. &ldquo;After five months we have thousands of users and hundreds of thousands in the pipeline through us and our partners. The overwhelming response makes it apparent that businesses &amp; organizations needed this technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The company powers their own card offering for small businesses that is available at no cost, The Dash Prepaid MasterCard &reg;, and powers FIS&rsquo;s card offering BizNow.  Karmic spent years rewriting code to bring antiquate payments systems into a digital world and now other companies seeking a card offering are relying on the company.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Karmic Labs uses technology to let supervisors manage spending and budgeting for employees, for example, and expense debit cards,&rdquo; said Jake Meiteles, Producer for the Innovations TV Series. &ldquo;We look forward to enlightening viewers on the amazing things they&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</p>
