<p><a href="https://www.healthcarepoint.com/">HealthCarePoint (HCP)</a>, a Texas-based healthcare and clinical research networking-technology company founded by patient survivors, today announced that it has successfully completed global testing of its innovative BlueCloud&reg; business model and networking technology and unveiled BlueCloud 2.0. In the past year, thousands of healthcare and clinical research organizations and other stakeholders have connected with BlueCloud 2.0 to help innovate its private, secure and verifiable network.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">BlueCloud 2.0, which provides a universal collaborative platform for the ACRES global network system, now supports unprecedented collaboration with 45 pharma, biotech, medical device sponsors, 14 clinical research organizations (CROs), eight institutional review boards (IRBs) and thousands of national and international healthcare provider organizations, allowing them to become innovative, by focusing on investigator site sustainability in clinical research and the implementation of solutions to help measure value=quality/payment in healthcare.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Nominated as one of the top new business and technology innovations in 2015 by PharmaVoice, BlueCloud is accepted by sponsors, clinical research organizations (CROs), institutional review boards (IRBs), universities, governments and healthcare organizations that understand they must collaborate to lower costs, improve industry image and improve patient care.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">BlueCloud 1.0 was released in January 2015 to globally test its on-demand networking capabilities and to promote quality, safety, operations management, compliance and crossover standards between healthcare and research organizations. The goal was to provide a transparent and accountable process that supports patient-human-subject protection and connect portals and siloes using standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect legacy systems to BlueCloud.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to Al O. Pacino, President of HealthCarePoint, BlueCloud 2.0 empowers healthcare professionals, employers and investigator sites to connect with sponsors, CROs, ethical review committees and other patient centric industry stakeholders to share and exchange information for business and regulatory purposes. BlueCloud has expanded its use to accountable care organizations (ACOs), hospitals and university medical centers to share verifiable information between departments and with other healthcare organizations. It also allows organizations to share information with insurance providers and other payer organizations, as provider data verification is now mandated by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services - an important step in connecting healthcare and clinical research.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Limited only by imagination, healthcare and clinical research stakeholders continue to implement new business models to help industry move forward into the digital age.</p>
