Further details of the integration will be released in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Keywords are the underpinning of what make digital asset management solutions effective. Without them, you just have a sea of files and this will help make sense of the chaos in many customer environments,&rdquo; said Toby Martin, Vice President of Development &amp; Strategy at Extensis. &ldquo;Through our work with Clarifai, we&rsquo;re automating the keywording process so customers have a strong base to work from within seconds.&rdquo;</p>
