<p>mParticle serves as the data platform of record to many of the world's leading brands, helping improve marketing and analytics output. The mParticle platform unifies data collection and makes it easy to connect that data to the variety of analytics, marketing, and data warehousing services that brands use to drive growth. The company has grown to manage over 1 billion mobile users each month, capturing over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$5 billion</span>in&nbsp;ecommerce&nbsp;transactions, and processing over 250 billion API calls.</p>
<p>In addition to longstanding relationships with renowned customers including Airbnb, King, and Spotify, mParticle has added several more&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">App Store</span>&nbsp;category leaders to its roster since announcing Series A funding in January, including Jet, Hulu, Foursquare, Postmates, and Chic Fil A. mParticle is now used by more category-leading mobile brands than all other customer data platforms combined.</p>
<p>The company has also introduced several major new product enhancements in the past year. Product highlights include: launching tvOS support for AppleTV; launching support for Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP); doubling the number of service partner integrations, from 60 to 120; releasing an integration with Google BigQuery; releasing integrations with all three leading marketing clouds (Adobe, Oracle, and Salesforce); releasing cross-device identity matching capabilities; and, implementing industry-leading encryption and security controls.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$17.5M</span>&nbsp;in additional funding brings the company's total capital raised to&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$37M</span>&nbsp;since inception in 2013. The new funding will be used to bring even more industry-leading multi-screen products to market and enable the company to scale operations.&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Scott Friend</span>, who led the investment for Bain Capital Ventures, will join the mParticle Board of Directors.&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Max Clark</span>&nbsp;has joined the company as the Chief Revenue Officer to lead the global sales force. Prior to joining mParticle, Clark was Vice President, Sales for the Oracle Social Cloud.</p>
<p>"We were attracted to how mParticle created the data platform for the next generation of mobile marketers and how it's now being used by more traditional marketers for whom mobile is of paramount importance but not their only concern," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Scott Friend</span>, Managing Director at Bain Capital Ventures. "The team that's been assembled here has had an incredible amount of prior success scaling marketing and advertising technology businesses, so we are big believers not only in the vision but also in their ability to execute upon it."</p>
<p>mParticle is also announcing today it has launched a new Profiles API. The API enables any customer to query a user record in their mParticle account and append that customer data to any existing system for a more complete view of the customer journey. For example, a customer service rep responding to a help desk ticket would be able to easily review a customer's full set of behaviors across web and app, to understand if the user is a frequent user, if they use the app or website more often, and what they were doing leading up to the issue they encountered.</p>
