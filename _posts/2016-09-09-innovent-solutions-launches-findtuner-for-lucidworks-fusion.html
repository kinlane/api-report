FindTuner is a solution tailored for merchandisers enabling them to enhance and personalize the online shopping experience, optimize revenue and profitability and deliver high-quality, relevant search results.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Lucidworks Fusion is a platform that provides enterprise-grade capabilities needed to design, develop, and deploy powerful search apps at any scaleâall built on the power of open core, open source Apache Solr. Fusion works as a standalone search platform or as an extension of an existing Solr implementation.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOver the years Innovent and Lucidworks have worked together seamlessly to provide a high-level of service and solutions to customers in the areas of Solr consulting, Solr training and implementations of Lucidworks Fusion.â said Keith Mericle, Innovent Solutionsâ CEO. âWith Innovent and Lucidworks having several joint clients using Solr and Fusion for eCommerce search it made a lot of sense to us to create an integrated solution of FindTuner and Fusion.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Solution highlights include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Fusion Integration: FindTuner features work in concert with Fusion query and index pipelines, complement and leverage signals and work seamlessly with Fusionâs powerful cluster management.</li>
<li>Sophisticated Business Logic: Rules may be triggered by a user interactions or external signals. From these signals, multiple merchandising actions may take place including banner displays, product promotions, guided navigation customization and others.</li>
<li>Rich Set of Actions: Actions include curated results definition, metrics-driven boost strategies, banner displays, page redirections, guided navigation display and zero-results handling. Powerful product display and manipulation rules can hide, show, promote, demote and perform other complex actions.</li>
<li>Ability to Manage Large Sets of Rules: Rules are organized with a smart tagging system that allows users to categorize rules into one or more tags. Rules can be located using powerful, embedded search.</li>
<li>Multi-store Capability: For merchants who have more than one storefront, the solution is designed to enable rule definition and management for multiple stores.</li>
<li>API for Seamless Integration: Deployment to the eCommerce site is a matter of integrating with an API.</li>
<li>Deployment: The solution can be installed on premise or hosted in the cloud.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Innovent also offers deployment consulting services focused on education and knowledge transfer along with development and deployment support to assist clients with launching the solution quickly.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Merchants that are already using Solr and Fusion will find FindTuner can be deployed rapidly. For merchants considering migrating to Solr and Fusion, Innovent provides end-to-end consulting and integration services that enable a seamless transition and fast time to market.</p>
