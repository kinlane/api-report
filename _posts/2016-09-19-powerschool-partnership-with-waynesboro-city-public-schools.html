The expanded partnership builds on the districtâs success with PowerSchoolâs student information system (SIS). Seamless integration between the SIS and registration solution will result in up-to-date student data by the first day of school.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âI had the opportunity to help build and launch PowerSchool Registration at another district. Its ease-of-use, flexibility, and unmatched functionality are valuable components of a robust solution. Weâre eliminating a 20-30 page paper packet to improve the registration process for families and school administrators,â said Kevin Harrison, Database Specialist at Waynesboro City Public Schools.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The electronic format allows families who have more than one child in the district to âsnapâ data from one student to another. SmartFormâ¢ technology, an intuitive tool built into the solution, collects relevant data based on previously entered information or choices (grade, activities, medical history, etc.). The data submitted by families is reviewed, polished, and formatted to meet district policies and then delivered into the SIS, resulting in accurate and up-to-date records on the first day of school.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWeâre excited about implementing the registration solution with the PowerSchool API as it allows school administrators to deliver data without exporting and importing files. This efficiency results in real-time, on-demand data delivery which saves a significant amount of time for our administrative personnel,â notes Harrison. âThe customer service offered is another reason why we selected PowerSchool. Theyâre a great company to work with, providing unparalleled consultation and support.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Waynesboro City Public Schools will also utilize the language localization feature to meet the needs of this diverse population by providing multilingual forms to families in English and Spanish. âWe evaluated costs of managing a paper-based student registration process. Moving this process online will save our district both time and money,â said Harrison. The online solution will be available to the school community on May 30, 2016.</p>
