<p>"The Kandy Cloud Center of Excellence will be a tremendous addition to our thriving tech landscape," said Mayor Watson. "I am proud of our City's ability to attract world-class R&amp;D companies, thanks to our skilled technology workforce and growing innovation community. I am confident that Kandy will see many benefits derive from its&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Ottawa</span>&nbsp;location, and that it will have a positive impact on our City."</p>
<p>The 70,000 square foot CoE, which will complement GENBAND's already-existing&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Ottawa</span>&nbsp;facilities, boasts a state-of-the-art lab. In addition to the leaders of R&amp;D, product management, security and tech support, and part of their globally distributed teams, the CoE will house newly-hired local employees, many of them new graduates.</p>
<p>"The appetite for embedded real-time communications is only growing, fueled by the Internet of Things and a recognition that contextual real-time communications are the best avenue towards value creation in today's digital landscape," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Paul Pluschkell</span>, founder and CEO of Kandy. "The CoE will enable us to further propel our development of these solutions and&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Ottawa</span>, aptly named 'the Silicon Valley of the North,' allows us to draw on a tech-savvy talent pool while participating in a thriving ecosystem."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The opening ceremony will include an ideathon for customers, employees and local developers. Kandy's state-of-the-art demo-equipped RV, the Kandymobile, will also be on site, and Mayor Watson will present a prize for the best product presentation.</p>
<p>"Businesses and developers around the world are leveraging the Kandy platform to connect over the cloud and deliver more human applications," added&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Sacha Gera</span>, Senior Vice President of Cloud Products. "Much of the intellectual property that supports Kandy was developed in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Ottawa</span>&nbsp;over the decades, so it's fitting that&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">Ottawa</span>-based engineers will once again play a key role in transforming the communications world."</p>
