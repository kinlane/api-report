<p class="responsiveNews">New functionality offered in SEMAÂ® 3.5 enhances the already comprehensive feature set of the existing, proven SEMAÂ® solution. ADLINKâs new SEMAÂ® 3.5 now supports state-of-the-art operating systems (OSs) such as Windows 10, and supports the latest x86 and ARM SoC generations. SEMAÂ® system performance and quality has also been improved, with call speed increased by 60 percent and added support for concurrent access of multiple processes and software applications leveraging SEMAÂ® functions in parallel.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With SEMAÂ® 3.5, ADLINK introduces an enhanced feature set and offers comprehensive hardware support at the board level. For instance, a history of last power-up sequence errors is logged, including detailed forensic information; this enables further investigation into technical issues in order to avoid unplanned system downtime. In addition, new 1-Wire support offers an easy-to-integrate serial interface that allows access to memory, security and temperature sensor devices.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOne of the many enhancements in SEMAÂ® 3.5 has been to extend the customization capabilities of the API we offer,â explained Dirk Finstel, executive vice president of ADLINKâs Module Computing Product Segment. âThis enables customers to develop tailored solutions and to integrate monitoring and control functions into their embedded systems.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SEMAÂ® 3.5 is supported on a broad spectrum of hardware platforms, with the majority of ADLINKÂ´s computer-on-modules, single board computers and embedded computer systems being SEMAÂ®-enabled. The intelligent middleware runs on the most widely used embedded operating systems and supports both x86 and ARM architectures.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SEMAÂ® 3.5 is provided to customers at no-cost for use in combination with SEMA-enabled ADLINK hardware. SEMAÂ® 3.5 helps customers to improve system reliability, reduce maintenance costs and ease system integration of embedded systems. Hence, it improves time-to-market (TTM) and total cost-of-ownership (TCO), key requirements for producing competitive products.</p>
