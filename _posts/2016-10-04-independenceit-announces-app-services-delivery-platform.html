<p><a href="http://www.independenceit.com/">IndependenceIT</a>, a cloud management platform provider that enables IT departments, service providers and ISVs to easily deploy Software Defined Data Centers, App Workloads and Cloud Workspaces, today announced general availability of its App Services Delivery Platform and the launch of a new channel program for independent software vendors (ISVs) and managed services providers (MSPs) to facilitate deployment of application services. App Services and the new channel program open new revenue channels for IndependenceIT partners entering the cloud-based application market.</p>
<p>App Services by IndependenceIT is designed for service providers to set up and manage application collections that can be delivered directly to any end-user device or published to an existing Cloud Workspace&reg; environment. App Services offers IT administrators an application publishing model that offers wizard driven workflow to define a new service, creation of software defined data center server infrastructure, application installation and management, and the publishing of applications to users or groups of users from a range of end-user organizations.</p>
<p>App Services Delivery Platform leverages the power of IndependenceIT&rsquo;s automation engine to support IT service providers with:</p>

<p>According to International Data Corporation (IDC)<sup>1</sup>, &ldquo;Cloud is a new paradigm of computing that will shape IT spending over the next several decades &ndash; the logical evolution of what IDC called &lsquo;dynamic IT&rsquo;&rdquo; for years. It entails shared access to virtualized resources over the Internet. IDC estimates that cloud services spending will continue to grow at double-digit rates for the next few years, gradually accounting for a larger proportion of all IT spending.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To promote the adoption of App Services, the company has announced its App Services Channel Program which provides a supportive on-ramp for ISVs and MSPs entering the cloud-based application market. New entrants to the program are provided with the following:</p>
