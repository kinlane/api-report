(âGenetecâ)</a>, a leading provider of open-architecture, IP security solutions today announced Genetec Clearanceâ¢, a case management system designed to speed up investigations by allowing different organizations to collect, manage and share video evidence and other relevant case information. Genetec Clearance will be showcased for the first time on booth #3517 at the IACP (International Association of Chiefs of Police) conference, taking place in San Diego, CA from October 15th to 18th 2016. Genetec Clearance is expected to be available in Q4 2016 via subscription, through certified Genetec channel partners and resellers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Genetec Clearance allows police officers, investigators and security managers to gather digital evidence from a variety of sources (such as Genetecâ¢ Security Center and other video management systems, body-worn devices, in-car systems and cellphone footage from bystanders and witnesses), and easily store, manage, review and share it from within a single application.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Genetec Clearance enables collaboration across independent agencies and private sector organizations. All pertinent files related to cases (video files as well as audio, images, documents etc.) are centralized and can be securely shared between investigators or requested by 3rd parties, without needing to physically ship or deliver the recordings. As the application is not licensed per seat, access can be shared with as many users as needed, without incurring any additional fees. With built-in video redaction, the privacy of bystanders can be protected by allowing identifiable information to be masked before sending video to other stakeholders. All user actions initiated within the system, whether internal or external, are automatically tracked to ensure the chain of custody of the evidence is maintained at all times.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"The increased evidence that is now available from video surveillance systems, body cameras, and from witnesses can help solve crimes. However, the sheer amount of data to be managed can also become cumbersome to process and review, increasing the time spent on case preparation, rather than the investigation. That's why we have developed a case management system to help automate certain tasks that are frequently performed manually today and to facilitate collaboration between law enforcement, corporate security departments, legal entities, and the public," explains Erick Ceresato, Product Manager at Genetec.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Organizations today are looking at ways to streamline their evidence sharing process while maintaining stringent audit capabilities. The growing volume of video recordings has become increasingly complex to manage and it is important for users to collaborate while also maintaining a clear chain of custody.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Larry Waite, Safe City & Corporate Security Manager with Ipswich City Council, Queensland, Australia recently evaluated Genetec Clearance. The Council routinely shares video with numerous outside entities and was looking to find a new approach to streamline the process.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Our existing tools did not allow the level of file sharing or auditability that Genetec Clearance offers. Being able to collaborate across teams and with the police department will speed up our case investigations process and reduce time and costs associated with collecting and sending recordings," says Waite.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Because Genetec Clearance supports many common video codecs, video evidence can easily be reviewed, while also eliminating the time-consuming manual process of video codec conversion. Designed as an open platform, Genetec Clearance APIs can be used to integrate with 3rd party systems and automate the upload of video recordings and associated metadata to be reviewed within the system. Integration with Record Management Systems (RMS) enables law enforcement departments to automate the creation of new cases with their existing record system, reducing the need for duplicate data entry.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Genetec Clearance will be available on a subscription basis and includes access to all the latest software updates and features. Updates are automated within the system as they become available, requiring no additional intervention from the clientâs own staff.
