<p>The icon platform <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> just added a f<a href="https://thenounproject.com/developers/">ree access tier to the icon API</a>, which lets you programmatically access the almost 10K icons, further evolving their API offering.</p>
<p>With the new API tier, there are two levels of API access. The playground tier gives you up to 5,000 calls a month, and the pro gives you more than 5K, starting at $150 a month.</p>
<p>The Noun Project launched a little over year ago, and the new access levels reflect the company's work to develop a sound business model for the icon sharing platform, and its supporting API.</p>
