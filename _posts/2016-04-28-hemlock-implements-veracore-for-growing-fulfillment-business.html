<p><a href="http://www.veracore.com/">VeraCore Software Solutions, Inc.</a> announced today that <a href="http://www.hemlock.com/">Hemlock Printers Ltd.</a>, of Burnaby, British Columbia has selected the VeraCore Fulfillment Solution to manage their growing fulfillment operation.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Established in 1968, Hemlock has grown to become one of the largest and most well respected commercial printers in the Pacific Northwest. Hemlock&rsquo;s comprehensive suite of services includes offset and digital printing, online solutions, prepress, digital photography, bindery, mailing, warehousing and fulfillment.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">From their secure, climate controlled warehouse, Hemlock manages numerous client fulfillment programs centered on both print and non-print collateral materials. Hemlock also manages magazine subscription fulfillment programs for several of its publishing clients. Hemlock&rsquo;s primary objective in evaluating fulfillment platforms was to identify a system that would enable them to more efficiently manage warehouse operations while maintaining their high degree of inventory accuracy, even as the business grew.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The VeraCore Warehouse Management System&rsquo;s support for barcode technology and rules based processing will enable them to increase fulfillment throughput &ndash; without a big increase to labor. Richard Kouwenhoven, Hemlock&rsquo;s President, commented on their decision, &ldquo;Fulfillment is definitely a growth area for us, so investing in this technology made sense. VeraCore provides our team with the tools to run a highly efficient warehouse operation which meets the expanding needs of our customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Another important consideration was VeraCore&rsquo;s ability to integrate with other technologies used by Hemlock.  The VeraCore Fulfillment Solution had already been integrated with several of the systems in use at Hemlock, including ecommerce, web-to-print and shipping systems. For cases in which an integration is not already available, VeraCore&rsquo;s API will enable Hemlock&rsquo;s development team to build their own integrations as needed.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Denise Lunden, President of VeraCore Software Solutions, Inc. noted, &ldquo;Hemlock does many different things for their clients and clearly embraces the philosophy that clients are best served by using the best tool available for the task at hand. I&rsquo;m confident that VeraCore will play an integral role in Hemlock&rsquo;s continued success in fulfillment&rdquo;.</p>
