<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a pathway for improving customer service, enhancing operations, and creating new business models. However, extracting timely, meaningful data from IoT devices often presents a roadblock to enabling these digital transformations. <a href="http://wso2.com/">WSO2</a> has published a new white paper that examines how IoT designers and architects can address this challenge by using big data analytics in a distributed, event-driven model.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Big Data Analytics in IoT</strong><br />The white paper, &ldquo;IoT Analytics: Using Big Data To Architect IoT Solutions,&rdquo; was written by WSO2 Vice President of Research Dr. Srinath Perera. He begins by discussing how to identify the varying requirements of an IoT system, such as, how fast results are needed and how much data must be kept.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Srinath then explores common requirements for conducting IoT analytics, such as time series processing, spatiotemporal analysis and forecasts, and anomaly detection. He also discusses how to act on IoT data, including:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualizing IoT data. </li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using data to detect problems.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Performing independent actions based on the data received. </li>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employing data to continuously monitor and control the environment.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Next, Srinath explains the differences between two IoT use cases: stationary dot (monitoring an already deployed system in operation) and moving dot (understanding and controlling the behavior of a system). He then discusses how an integrated, ready-to-go analytics solution can help both scenarios. Srinath concludes by discussing how the recently launched WSO2 Data Analytics Server 3.0, WSO2&rsquo;s high-performance analytics platform, combines real-time and batch analysis with analytics at the edge and predictive analytics via machine learning to support the multiple demands of IoT solutions.</p>
