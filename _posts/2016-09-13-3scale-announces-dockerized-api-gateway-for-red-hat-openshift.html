Customers using OpenShift can more easily deploy the 3scale API Gateway with a few clicks to integrate APIs with 3scaleâs API Management Platform. Benefits include the ability to consistently create applications from microservices between environments wherever they are hosted. The integration allows customers to do tasks in more contained and simple ways, helping to lessen the margin for error, fewer manual steps, and with greater flexibility and control. Ultimately, the combined power of PaaS, containers, microservices, DevOps, and API management supports enterprise agility and bi-modal IT. The feature is available now to API providers on all 3scale plans. Learn more about how to deploy and configure the Docker image of the 3scale API Gateway here.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Further benefits include the ability to control and distribute gateways wherever they are needed in local deployments, or in cloud or on-premise deployments using the same stack. It also supports DevOps automation and configuration management. The gateway is well-suited for API providers using Red Hat OpenShift V3, who have different instances running in hybrid, cloud or in on-premise environments, or those who are migrating from one environment to another.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âCustomers using OpenShift can more easily deploy the 3scale API Gateway in just a few clicks on OpenShift to leverage the many benefits of this enterprise-class PaaS,â said Steven Willmott, CEO of 3scale. âThis integration was a logical next step in our collaboration with Red Hat to offer a full-stack API solution, and itâs in line with our recent decision to join OpenShift Commons to contribute to the growth of the OpenShift ecosystem.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">OpenShift is an open source, enterprise-class platform-as-a-service (PaaS) with community and development leadership provided by Red Hat. OpenShift allows application developers to automate the hosting, configuration, deployment, and administration of application stacks in an elastic cloud environment that can scale based on demand. OpenShift is built with standards in mind, so any application written on it can more easily be moved to another environment that supports the same languages, helping to lessen vendor dependency and lock-in.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe are pleased to collaborate with 3scale as they build a container application platform into their cloud strategy and give customers access to the power of Linux containers at scale in a DevOps environment,â said Julio Tapia, director, OpenShift Ecosystem, Red Hat. âOpenShift Enterprise enables a wider choice of programming languages and runtimes for enterprises adopting a container architecture, allowing them to more quickly modernize workloads with less disruption.â</p>
