<p><a href="http://www.boardeffect.com/">BoardEffect</a>, the leading board management software solution for mission-based organizations worldwide, today released its Integration Panel, the first of its kind in the board portal industry. With this ground-breaking innovation, BoardEffect enables easy integration of its board portal with any solution supporting the work of governing bodies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;High-performing boards increasingly seek to leverage their board portal platforms in concert with other mission-critical solutions.&rdquo; said Todd Gibby, CEO of BoardEffect. &ldquo;BoardEffect specializes in solving the specific and pressing problems inherent in board-related work, but also recognizes the need to support our clients&rsquo; diverse business needs. The BoardEffect Integration Panel achieves that objective by ensuring that BoardEffect works very well with other systems. It also continues to reinforce our guiding principle of making BoardEffect super simple to use.&rdquo;</p>

Single Sign-On integrations allow IT teams to leverage their current methods of user management for simplified control over user accounts and access.
