<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_112038_3cl_logo.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.3clogic.com">3CLogic</a>, a leading provider of cloud communication as a service, today announced it latest software release in which it unveiled its new hybrid cloud solution. The release comes at a time when the delivery of next generation communications for both enterprises and the contact center industry is undergoing a huge evolution in favor of a hybrid cloud model as broader adoption of cloud solutions continues to grow. More importantly, as organizations increasingly seek to achieve a competitive advantage by improving the customer experience, the need for a flexible, secure, and reliable communications platform has never been more crucial and yet so lacking within current solutions. With its latest release, 3CLogic aims to fill the gap by offering a greater degree of freedom regarding the delivery of its cloud communication software, while extending its library of APIs to allow for more client-driven implementations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe recognize that despite cloud-first strategies dominating most roadmaps, the migration to cloud can be more complex for organizations still heavily tethered to existing on-premise systems,â explains Raj Sharma, COO at 3CLogic. âOur latest platform helps to facilitate cloud adoption by leveraging a companyâs existing investment in system infrastructure, such as Cisco and Avaya, while extending the efficiencies and scalability of our latest end-to-end cloud communication platform. It truly offers the best of both worlds.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Leveraging its existing distributed architecture technology and utilization of Amazon Web Services (AWS), 3CLogicâs newest hybrid cloud solution introduces the use of microservices to deliver cloud communication in a manner which allows for the decomposition of individual applications. As a result, businesses are given the freedom to weave single services (IVR, Call Distribution, Automated Dialing, Reporting, etc.) to build useful business processes, integration flows, or user experiences, while integrating with existing on-premise systems (i.e.: Cisco, Avaya, etc.). With communication services segmented, organizations can âthink big but build smallâ while synchronizing IT agility with business demand to meet service level agreements for voice quality, security, and reliability.</p>
