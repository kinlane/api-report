<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/curbcall_logo.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://curbcall.com">Boston-based real estate tech company CurbCall, Inc.</a> just announced a joint marketing and distribution deal with Onboard Informatics, a leader in data-driven consumer engagement. Onboard will offer two products from CurbCall to reinforce their position as leaders in consumer engagement. These include the on-demand lead routing platform CurbCall Connectâ¢ and the home showing safety app CurbCall Protectâ¢.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOnboard is dedicated to providing break-through technology that helps realtors better engage consumers,â said Onboard Informatics President Jonathan Bednarsh. âAnd in CurbCall Connect, we saw a game-changing lead routing platform that empowers agents to engage consumers instantly in real time, at the moment of intent.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWeâre thrilled to partner with a real estate technology leader like Onboard Informatics,â said Stephanie Sullivan, CEO of CurbCall. âBeing able to be part of an integrated solution for engaging real estate consumers makes for a far more powerful offering than we could offer on our own.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Itâs well-known throughout the industry, that the first agent to respond to and engage with consumer has a high likelihood of closing them. But according to CurbCall Chief Marketing officer Mason Wiley, agents are hampered by the limitations of current lead routing systems. âHalf of consumers today expect instant response, and over 75% expect a response within 30 minutes, but the average response time for real estate agents is 15.29 hours and 48% of buyer inquiries are never responded to at all,â said Wiley. âCurbCall Connectâs intelligent lead routing technology allows engagement to happen near instantaneously.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Providing seamless API integration with the existing user interface for any website or mobile app, CurbCall Connect adds the capability for consumers to request immediate agent assistance. The CurbCall Connect platform has the built-in intelligence to instantly route that request though a smartphone app to agents who are qualified to provide assistance and are available to respond âright now.â It also provides an administrative dashboard providing reporting and analytics on the disposition of inbound leads and agent performance in responding for full accountability. See the demo at curbcall.com/connect-demo.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition to CurbCall Connect, Onboard will also be offering the safety app CurbCall Protect. âGiven the number of crimes against realtors that occur every year, weâre grateful for Onboardâs support in getting CurbCall Protect into the hands of agents,â said Sullivan. âIf we can save the lives of even just one or two real estate professionals, that will make all of our efforts worth it.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">CurbCall Protect is a standalone smartphone app that makes it easy for agents to be safer during showings. With the press of a single button, agents can send an SMS text to their emergency contacts alerting them that they have begun a showing with a link to a map that displays the agentâs location in real time. The app also includes a panic button the agent can press if they feel in danger during the showing, plus a âsafety radiusâ feature that instantly delivers an automatic alert to the agentâs emergency contacts should the agent unexpectedly leaves the showing area.
