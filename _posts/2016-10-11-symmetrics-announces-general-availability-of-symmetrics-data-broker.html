<p><a href="http://www.symmetrics.com">Symmetrics Business Intelligence</a>, a provider of reporting solutions for contact centers, today announced the general availability of the Symmetrics Data Broker, a revolutionary new reporting platform that unifies real-time, historical, and contact detail data streams within a single, &ldquo;big data&rdquo; architecture. The new platform is currently in use by key customers in North America and Europe.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With the Symmetrics Data Broker, contact center administrators can a use single data integration platform to seamlessly mix and match real-time data streams with historic, summarized, and/or contact detail information in customized reports, scorecards and dashboards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our mission in the contact center reporting world has always been to break down the silos of data between contact center systems,&rdquo; says Richard McElroy, Symmetrics president and chief operating officer. &ldquo;First, our Symmetrics Data Mart eliminated data silos from the historic data stored in ACDs, IVRs, workforce management systems and other contact center applications. But another barrier remained &mdash; the walls between real-time data streams, historic data repositories with aggregated and summarized data, and the very granular contact detail data that tracks every step of the customer interaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;What we needed was a new kind of platform that uses proven &lsquo;big data&rsquo; technologies to unite these three data domains using a single architecture. The Symmetrics Data Broker is that platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Proven &ldquo;</strong>Lamdba<strong>&rdquo; Architecture</strong><br />The Symmetrics Data Broker is based on the &ldquo;lambda&rdquo; data processing architecture designed to handle massive quantities of data through both streaming and batch-processing methods. Using a generic architecture designed for scalability and fault-tolerance, the Symmetrics Data Broker uses this proven method for collecting, processing and analyzing huge amounts of real-time data from virtually any contact center system that provides it. It can also aggregate and store such data for long-term trend reporting through conventional data warehouses like the Symmetrics Data Mart.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Furthermore, the Symmetrics Data Broker can act as an enabling service for core contact center systems requiring outside data &mdash; for instance, Symmetrics has developed &ldquo;snap-ins&rdquo; offering data retrieval and storage capabilities to Avaya Breeze, Avaya&rsquo;s engagement development platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>An Open Platform</strong><br />McElroy notes that while the Symmetrics Data Broker can act as the common integration platform for the rest of Symmetrics Suite&rsquo;s reporting modules, each of these modules can still be deployed independently or together in any combination a customer needs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">And as a completely open platform, the Symmetrics Data Broker can integrate with any third-party reporting solution the customer may choose, just like the rest of Symmetrics Suite, he adds.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;With the Symmetrics Data Broker, we finally have a single architecture that effectively erases the boundaries between real-time, historical, and contact-detail data as it is created,&rdquo; McElroy concludes. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s real-time data can form the basis of tomorrow&rsquo;s historical trend report &mdash; or cradle-to-grave audit report.&rdquo;</p>
