The service called CyberActiveSM SAAS provides organizations an easy to consume service for securing their apps, APIs, and web services in a continuous model that is in step with their agile and dev/ops development processes. With CyberActiveSM SAAS organizations also get security monitoring of their cloud environment and compliance to leading security standards like ISO 27001, NIST CSF, and SOC II. CyberActiveSM SAAS is a subscription service that does not require any investment in software, and uniquely does not require the code to leave customer networks and VPCs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Under the hood, Paladionâs RisqVU platform integrates with leading source code repositories, build servers and buck tracking systems to deliver seamless secure bug detection, reporting, and resolution flow. The RisqVU platform leverages HPE Fortify for conducting on demand incremental code reviews.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Rajat Mohanty, CEO, Paladion, said, âWe have been working with software companies for over a decade and nearly all of them are embracing the agile or dev/ops development model. Working with a few clients closely we developed the CyberActiveSM SAAS offering to solve several core security challenges faced by software and SAAS companies. In a nutshell, we have grossly simplified the way apps and customer data is secured in development, testing, and continuous operations. We rely on Fortify to help us achieve the high quality outcomes our clients need. We are proud to sponsor Protect 2016 and will be showcasing our service packs for HPE Fortify and HPE ArcSight technologies at our booth #SB15.â</p>
