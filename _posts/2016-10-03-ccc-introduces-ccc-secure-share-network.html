<p><a href="http://www.cccsecureshare.com">CCC Information Services Inc. (&ldquo;CCC&rdquo;) </a>announced today the launch of its CCC Secure Share&trade; Network (CCC Secure Share), a network using a cloud-based application program interface (API) that will allow collision repairers to control the distribution of their data and better secure the data shared with third-party application providers. CCC Secure Share will utilize the Business Message Suite (BMS), the current data standard published by the Collision Industry Electronic Commerce Association (CIECA). In addition to further securing collision repairer data, CCC Secure Share enables application providers to deliver their services to CCC&rsquo;s network of collision repairers through a single connection, eliminating the need to create individual connections with hundreds or thousands of collision repairers. CCC Secure Share will be provided to collision repairers as part of the CCC ONE&reg; Total Repair Platform at no additional charge.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">CCC Secure Share will be available for collision repairers next year. CCC will continue to support the export of Estimate Management Standard (EMS) files for a period of time to allow companies to prepare for the change. Third-party application providers can get more information on registration and pricing for CCC Secure Share by visiting http://www.cccsecureshare.com.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;CCC&rsquo;s decision to support the BMS standard is part of our ongoing commitment, and a multimillion dollar investment to better secure data shared through the CCC ONE&reg; platform,&rdquo; said Joseph Allen, Senior Vice President, Automotive Services, CCC. &ldquo;We built CCC Secure Share using open technology so it would have the dual benefit of providing data security, while enabling new technologies and innovations to connect to the industry and bring new solutions to collision repairers. Our rollout plan is designed to provide ample time for application providers to complete the development needed to connect to CCC Secure Share.&rdquo;</p>
