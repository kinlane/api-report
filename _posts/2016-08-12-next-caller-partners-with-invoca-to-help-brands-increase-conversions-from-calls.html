<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api-evangelist-site/news/Anti-Spoofing_for_Enterprise___Next_Caller.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p>With mobile users reporting that they turn to a conversation for their most important business interactions, <a href="http://www.nextcaller.com">Next Caller</a>, the Advanced Caller ID solution, has partnered with <a href="http://www.invoca.com">Invoca</a>, the call intelligence company, to enable brands to drive more conversions from these phone calls.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Starting immediately, Invoca customers that opt into this new premium service will have access to Next Callerâs rich caller data linking telephone numbers -- including mobile numbers -- to over 50 data points, including name, address, email, demographic data, social media profiles, and more. The data, used by Fortune 100 brands to small businesses, allows for more intelligent call routing, prioritization, and an improved, personalized customer experience.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWeâre excited to partner with an industry leader like Invoca,â said Next Caller CEO, Ian Roncoroni. âWith the Next Caller integration, brands on the Invoca platform will have more detailed information on phone calls in real-time, enabling them to provide better service, enhance marketing personalization, and increase conversions.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to Next Caller, US businesses receive about 50 billion calls every year, but only know who's calling about 40 percent of the time. This means businesses must manually identify about 30 billion callers every year. The associated cost of that talk time and data entry is about 52 cents per call, meaning an organization that fields 10,000 calls per month could save up to $60,000 per year using Advanced Caller ID.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In addition, the most commonly cited frustrations for consumers are waiting on hold, and repeating their information once the call is answered. By dramatically increasing automatic identification to over 85 percent, Advanced Caller ID allows callers to avoid pain points that negatively impact customer experience, while also ensuring that the business collects rich, valuable data that can be leveraged during the call, and long afterwards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe most important customer interaction you can have is a live phone conversation,â said Kyle Christensen, VP of Marketing at Invoca. âBy partnering with Next Caller weâre giving marketers a deeper level of real-time insights about callers, which they can use to more intelligently route a call or even deliver a more personalized email or retargeting ad, for example. â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A diverse array of enterprise brands, including The New York Times Store, OpenTable and Frontier Communications rely on Invocaâs Call Intelligence platform to provide the analytics and automation required for the most critical part of the omnichannel customer journey. Next Caller is the first third-party company that Invoca has partnered with to extract this type of targeted data from phone calls.</p>
