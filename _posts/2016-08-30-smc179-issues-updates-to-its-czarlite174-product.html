<p><a href="http://www.smc3.com/">SMC&sup3;</a> has announced that effective September 19, 2016, the data in CzarLite&reg; and CzarLite &reg;XL has been updated to reflect the economic impact of rising transportation expenses and changes to the United States, Canadian and Mexican postal code systems. CzarLite base rate updates do not include fuel price adjustments, which are addressed separately by each carrier.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SMC&sup3; regularly updates CzarLite, the industry&rsquo;s premier less-than-truckload base rate and benchmarking system for shipments within the United States and between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Updating CzarLite involves computations that reflect U.S. motor carriers&rsquo; operating expenses &ndash; costs that include geographic labor variations; speed, weight and restricted road limits; chronic head-haul imbalances; and other factors.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Economists Donald Ratajczak, Ph.D., and Irwin Silberman, Ph.D., certified the methodology behind SMC&sup3;&rsquo;s update to ensure the data and processes are accurate and the update produces equitable baseline rates. Both economists have experience with the transportation industry and lengthy histories of economic analysis, research and forecasting. Their recommendations related to the economic portion of the CzarLite update assure the practical, fair and unbiased nature of CzarLite&reg; rates.</p>
