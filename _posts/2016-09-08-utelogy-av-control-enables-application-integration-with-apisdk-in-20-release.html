<p class="responsiveNews">This latest version, Utelogy 2.0, is the combination of years of technology experience, combined with the needs and wants of users, resulting in the most comprehensive Audio/Visual Control, Management, and Analytics platform ever.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âUtelogy 2.0 is easy to deploy, enhance and maintain, so integrators can focus on meeting customer needsâ¦now and in the future. Because itâs pure software, Utelogy 2.0 integrates with the enterprise software, UC platforms and AVoverIP technologies that the industry is leveraging,â explained Utelogy CTO Scott McGarrigle.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWith the available U-Access service, you can integrate with your Active Directory or other identity management service to provide user authentication, multi-language and a personalized experience,â explained McGarrigle. âThis really enables the BYOD movement.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Integrators can now deliver valued-added services to their customers by leveraging the Utelogy 2.0 platform to implement a recurring and services-oriented business model that enhances a strategic customer relationship. âWith NOC functionality built-right in, integrators can monitor, provide remote-support, automated reports, and even remotely configure the system. Weâve added white labeling capabilities and if you combine that with the release of our API and SDK for third party enterprise application integration to add services like hosted video or hosted concierge, integrators can become a full-service resource for their customers,â added McGarrigle.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThis new functionality really gives integrators the opportunity to add tremendous value to their clients to create a long-term business relationship that takes the power of software-defined AV to the next level.</p>
