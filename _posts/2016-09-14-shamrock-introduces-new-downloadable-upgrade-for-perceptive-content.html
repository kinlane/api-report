<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_59789_shamrock_logo.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://shamrocksolutionsllc.com/">Shamrock</a> today announced that is has introduced the first downloadable upgrade for customers using Perceptive Content. The company will continue to offer its traditional, on-site update process for Lexmark Enterprise Software products as part of its broad range of professional services, but now gives users the option to update to the latest version of the industry leading process and content management system via the web.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Typically, a Shamrock implementation specialist visits a client site to help set up, test and implement the latest iteration of Perceptive Content. Over the past few years, the company has refined its project planning and deployment methodology so that this process is as fast as possible. Now its new solution offers Perceptive Content users the promise of an even more rapid timeline.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWith our new downloadable upgrade for Perceptive Content, customers can go from project kickoff to user acceptance testing in as little as four days,â said Shamrock CEO and founder Robert Albright.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Another advantage of the new API download alternative is that it requires less involvement from the customerâs internal IT/IS team, making the process not only faster but also more cost-effective. The second factor that lowers the cost is that no staff member from Shamrock needs to come onsite. Instead, the company delivers a fully performance tested environment via its secure Azure server, with the customer only needed to download an API file to VMware, enter a key and move DB and OSM files across.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOur goal is always to help our users get the greatest benefit from their ECM system as quickly as possible, and the new upgrade option checks both these boxes,â Albright said. âItâs going to help any customer who needs to go live with the latest version quickly and wants to keep their IT team focused on other projects.â</p>
