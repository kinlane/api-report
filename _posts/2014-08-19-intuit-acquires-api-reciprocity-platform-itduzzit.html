<p>The accounting platform <a href="https://developer.intuit.com/blog/2014/08/13/intuit-acquires-itduzzit-syncing-data-between-cloud-apps-gets-easier">Intuit has purchased the API automation, integration, and reciprocity platform itDuzzit</a>, as well as bringing on itDuzzit&rsquo;s founders Joe Dennis and Steve Mendoza as part of the Intuit Partner Platform team.</p>
<p>The Intuit announcement recognizes that this new breed of reciprocity providers reach beyond a core developer audience:</p>
<blockquote><em>The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required.  With their technology combined with the range of QuickBooks platform services we already offer, the breadth and depth of integrations our partners can build will grow tremendously. itDuzzit&rsquo;s sophisticated rules-based engine really set them apart from the competition, and their technology benefits the entire QuickBooks Online ecosystem: third-party developers, accountants and small businesses.</em></blockquote>
<p>Reciprocity platforms like <a href="http://cloud.itduzzit.com/">itDuzzit</a>, <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>, and <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> are proving to be a very valuable addition to any developer platform, allowing the APIs to be put to use by the average business user, and going beyond just developers and system integrators--reaching actual business problem owners.</p>
<p>According to Intuit, both teams are already working to figure out how to integrate the technology into the <a href="https://developer.intuit.com">Intuit Partner Platform</a>.</p>
