<p>It&rsquo;s with great excitement that AMGtime comes to APA Congress 2016 in Nashville. <a href="http://amgtime.com/">AMGtime Systems</a> has been moving toward seamless integration since the launch of Universal API last year and today with that API allows for connection with any systems that have API solutions and are open to integration.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AMGtime has made so many feature enhancements and positive changes that they can&rsquo;t wait to share at APA Congress this year. Go to Booth 635 and check out some of these enhancements, which include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Single Login on AMG Web and Mobile &ndash; A new feature has been added making it easier for administrative users to switch to an employee view from admin view. Using this featAure, managers will be able to login from a single account and switch between both views as authorized.</li>
<li>Partner Portal for AMG Web &ndash; The feature has been added to help AMGtime&rsquo;s partners, including Payroll providers, to manage multiple customers from a single portal with one login.</li>
<li>Payroll-Based Journal for Nursing Homes &ndash; AMGtime already had the capability to allow nursing homes to do NHPPD reporting per state government regulations. Recently they added the PBJ export feature that allows Nursing Homes to export necessary data to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services per ACA regulation.</li>
<li>USigned &ndash; One of the notable updates is AMGtime&rsquo;s electronic signature feature, which allows for paperless timecard signing by employees and supervisors. With multilevel approval levels and email integration, timecard signing can be effortless.</li>

<li>Addition of Payroll Exports &ndash; New payroll exports have also been added amongst these included eEmpACT, StaffSuite, Paychex Flex, PayServ, Spectrum. The company&rsquo;s solutions now support over 90 payroll exports.</li>
<li>Seamless Integration with Payroll - One of the most important upgrades that AMGtime brings to this show is seamless integration between their time systems and existing payroll systems.
