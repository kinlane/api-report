<p>The companies announced today that a major step in their ongoing collaboration will begin later this month with the integration of Facebook Login in Blizzardâs PC games. This will enable players to sign up for and log in to games such asÂ <em>World of Warcraft</em><sup><em>Â®</em></sup><em>, Heroes of the Storm</em><sup><em>Â®</em></sup><em>, Hearthstone</em><sup><em>Â®</em></sup><em>, Diablo</em><sup><em>Â®</em></sup><em>Â III, StarCraft</em><sup><em>Â®</em></sup><em>Â II,Â </em>and Blizzardâs most recent blockbuster release,Â <em>Overwatch</em><sup><em>Â®</em></sup><em>,Â </em>using their Facebook accounts.</p>
<p>Adding Facebook Login will pave the way for new social functionality in Blizzard games while highlighting Facebookâs capabilities as a platform for sharing, viewing, and discussing AAA game content. As an example, Blizzard is in the process of incorporating Facebookâs Live API in order to create its own âGo Liveâ streaming functionality for its games. When this functionality is implemented, players will for the first time be able tolivestreamÂ their Blizzard-gaming sessions directly to their Facebook timelines, and friends will be able to subscribe and be notified when new streams are available.</p>
<p>âBlizzard games are best when played with friends, so itâs important to us to provide our players with features and services that make it easy and fun to share their experiences with each other,â said Gio Hunt, executive vice president of corporate operations at Blizzard Entertainment. âWeâre working closely with Facebook on this integration forÂ <em>Overwatch,</em>Â as well as our other games, and we look forward to sharing further details on our plans as developmentÂ progresses.â</p>
<p>As part of the collaboration between the two companies, Blizzard recently hosted multipleÂ livestreamsÂ via Facebook. The first series of streams centered on Heroes of the Dorm<sup>â¢</sup>, Blizzardâs collegiate tournament featuring its popular team-brawlerÂ <em>Heroes of the Storm.Â </em>Last week, Blizzard hosted aÂ livestreamedÂ launch event forÂ <em>Overwatch</em>Â on Facebook.</p>
<p>âBlizzard has a passionate community of players, and an incredible track record for launching innovative and high-quality gaming experiences,â said Leo Olebe, global games partnerships director at Facebook. âOur collaboration onÂ <em>Overwatch</em>Â demonstrates Facebookâs commitment to partnering with AAA game companies, while further empowering Blizzard gamers to connect and share the content theyâre most passionate about with the friends they play withÂ around the world.â</p>
<p>In preparation for theÂ <em>OverwatchÂ </em>launch, Facebook worked with Blizzard on a comprehensive mix of Facebook and Instagram marketing solutionsâincluding Carousel ads, Canvas, and Instagram Marquee. Using the platformsâ powerful targeting capabilities, Facebook helped Blizzard present the game to a broad set of gaming and entertainment audiences within Facebookâs and Instagramâs global audiences of 1.65 billion and 400 million people respectively. On Facebook, more than 650 million people play games connected to Facebook every month acrossÂ web, mobile, and console.</p>
<p><em>OverwatchÂ </em>is a dynamic team-based shooter in which players choose from a cast of 21 diverse heroesâeach with their own unique arsenal of extraordinary weapons and incredible abilitiesâand battle to complete objectives in various locations across a near-future earth. The gameÂ is available now for PlayStationÂ®4 computer entertainment system, Xbox One, and Windows<sup>Â®</sup>Â PC in English, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, German, European Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Russian, Korean (PC only), Japanese (PC and PS4â¢ system only), and traditional and simplified Chinese (PC only). The game has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB.</p>
