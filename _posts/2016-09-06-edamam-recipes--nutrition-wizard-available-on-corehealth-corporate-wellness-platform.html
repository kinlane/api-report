<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;CoreHealth is excited to add Edamam to our growing list of wellness products and services available on our Wellness Network,&rdquo; said Anne Marie Kirby, CEO of CoreHealth Technologies. &ldquo;As people become more aware of what they are eating and how the food they consume affects their bodies, minds and overall health, Edamam gives people the resources they need to easily respect their diet restrictions while enjoying the food they eat. Food is a pleasure but it can be difficult when there are limitations. Edamam makes the process easier and helps everyone cook well-balanced, healthy, flavorful meals.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We believe our partnership with CoreHealth is a natural fit.

<p class="responsiveNews">Edamam&rsquo;s Recipe Finder helps those people on strict diets to avoid falling into a rut by eating the same few meals considered &lsquo;safe&rsquo;, which can result in food boredom and poor nutrition due to a lack of variety and nutrients. With a database of 1.5 million nutritionally analyzed recipes from around the web specific to any desired parameter, Recipe Finder provides employees with ingredients and nutrient content, along with cooking instructions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Edamam&rsquo;s Nutrition Wizard helps people instantly determine calories, macronutrients (fats, carbs and protein) and 20+ micronutrients (cholesterol, sodium, vitamins, etc.) using a recipe or ingredient list for those meals prepared and cooked at home.
