This program will focus on working with technology partners to offer pre-built, no cost integrations for customers to leverage when expanding their commerce ecosystem.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For mid-market retailers today, integration can be up to 40% of the implementation cost. Freestyle Nexus allows customers to easily integrate their OMS solutions with market-leading applications, reducing cost, complexity and time. With a simplified on-boarding process for partners, integrations will span a broad range of technologies, including ecommerce platforms, POS, ERP, CRM, payment processors, tax, shipping providers and more, giving Freestyle customers a choice of product integrations not available from any other OMS provider.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The program is open to complementary technology partners and is free to join. Freestyle customers and other members of the Nexus Partner Community, including systems integrators, can access the integrations and accompanying documentation at no cost through the Nexus Marketplace.</p>
