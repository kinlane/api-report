<p><a href="http://www.supervisedit.com">SupervisedIT</a>, a provider of managed cloud hosting, has announced the introduction of a new zero-downtime public and private cloud platform based on OpenStack. SupervisedIT is part of the ServerMania group, and benefits from ServerMania&rsquo;s decade-long experience of building high-performance, infrastructure hosting platforms for business.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SupervisedIT&rsquo;s OpenStack public cloud platform provides high-availability virtual compute and storage infrastructure with instant server creation and scaling. Infrastructure control is fast and intuitive with SupervisedIT&rsquo;s bespoke cloud web interface, and infrastructure-as-code control is provided by OpenStack&rsquo;s flexible and comprehensive API.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Engineered for redundancy, performance, and scalability, SupervisedIT&rsquo;s private cloud platform combines the enhanced agility and efficiency of a virtual platform with the security and control of wholly private physical infrastructure. SupervisedIT&rsquo;s custom OpenStack private clouds are more cost effective than on-premise physical infrastructure.</p>
