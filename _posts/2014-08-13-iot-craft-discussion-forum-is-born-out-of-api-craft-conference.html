<p>If you are in the API industry you know about the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/api-craft">API Craft Google Group</a> started by <a href="http://bit.ly/1oKcFjf">Apigee</a>. The forum is the go to place when you want to have conversations with the experts across the API industry, which has been so active it has spawned Meetup groups in multiple cities, as well as the annual open conference in Detroit, <a href="http://bit.ly/1zIq2sl">API Craft</a>.</p>
<p>After this years API-Craft conference, Chris Wilson (<a href="https://twitter.com/datamoor">@datamoor</a>) held a <a href="https://github.com/apicraft/detroit2014/wiki/APIs-for-Things">popular session on "APIs for Things&rdquo;</a>, reflecting the growing importance of APIs when it comes to IoT.</p>
<p>In response, the API-Craft organizers have now launched <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iot-craft">IoT Craft</a>, a forum for discussion of all things APIs as they apply to the Internet of Things. If IoT Craft is anything like API Craft, it will be the place you go to learn about not just the tech of APIs being applied to IoT, but also the business, security, and other hot button issues around connecting devices to the Internet using APIs.</p>
