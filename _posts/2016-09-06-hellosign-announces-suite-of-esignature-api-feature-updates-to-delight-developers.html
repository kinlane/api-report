<p><a href="https://www.hellosign.com">HelloSign</a>, the easiest way to electronically sign legally binding documents, announces today a suite of API feature updates designed to enhance the developer experience and to arm businesses with the best eSignature experience available for their customers. HelloSign&rsquo;s API makes it very easy to integrate eSignatures into any application or website, delivering seamless and secure eSigning directly within those applications. The announced improvements represent HelloSign&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and a deliberate focus on empowering businesses through the industry&rsquo;s leading eSignature API.</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">"The HelloSign API has been a huge win for Brokermint. It resides within our real estate back office platform, allowing our clients to execute all documents electronically and eliminates the need to print, scan, or navigate to a 3rd party eSignature tool," said Andrew Chishchevoy, Co-founder of Brokermint. "HelloSign allowed us to offer our users a fully paperless platform. Since integrating the HelloSign API, we increased the conversion ratio on the sales side by 23%. It's also been a huge benefit for customer retention."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The innovative updates to the HelloSign eSignature API vastly improve the experience for developers, signature requesters, and signers alike. As a direct result of these updates, businesses using the HelloSign API can now integrate eSignatures into their website or workflow in an average of 2.5 days &mdash; faster than any eSignature API available. The HelloSign API is the only eSignature API to offer complete white labeling capabilities as well as an API Dashboard that enables developers to easily debug and track overall usage. In addition, the HelloSign API uniquely offers extended templates for on-demand marketplaces that need to pass the ability to brand and customize to multiple customer tiers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Investing in thoughtful and deliberate innovation of our API is a top priority for us as we see more and more businesses wanting a seamless experience for their customers to sign documents online,&rdquo; says Neal O&rsquo;Mara, Co-founder and CTO at HelloSign. &ldquo;HelloSign&rsquo;s agile development practices combined with our unparalleled focus on user and developer experience make it possible for businesses to take advantage of the many benefits of eSignatures and to innovate quickly and painlessly.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Updates for Developers <br />API updates made specifically to enhance the developer experience include: <br />-Improved coordinate system for specifying field locations &mdash; Developers can now determine exactly where in a document they'd like to implement a specific signer element with the new &ldquo;page&rdquo; parameter. The new coordinate system will use the commonly used standard of 72 dpi resolution for displaying web images. <br />-An auto-generated email to developers for API errors &mdash; Clearer error handling for developers so they can address API-related errors much faster. <br />-Unlimited templates for testing &mdash; Developers are no longer limited in creating templates when testing their integrations. These templates are locked, can only be used in test mode, and can be unlocked when an API plan is purchased.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Updates for Requesters <br />API updates made specifically to enhance the requester experience include: <br />-White labeling for embedded and non embedded signature requests &mdash; Signers now have a much better user experience as the signer page can now be customized to resemble any organization&rsquo;s look and feel. <br />-Rate limit increase &mdash; The API request limit per hour has been increased so that those with uneven signature request volume can send more in a short period of time. <br />-Data validation &mdash; Specific rules can now be set to each text field in documents. This prevents signer typos and increases the accuracy of the information collected.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Updates for Signers <br />API updates made specifically to enhance the signer experience include: <br />-Added language support for signer page &mdash; Added translation support to the signer page for more flexibility for international documents. <br />-Custom redirect capability &mdash; Signers can now be redirected to a custom website after signing a document, giving API customers more flexibility and control over their customers&rsquo; experience. <br />-Editable merge fields &mdash; Signers are now able to edit pre-populated data as specified by the requester. <br />-Elimination of rendering documents into images &mdash; The file size of documents that have been set up for signature have been dramatically reduced. PDF files now have much better clarity and all documents are now searchable for any specified text or phrase.</p>
