The move brings its proprietary logistics technology and highly-rated service to Florida for the first time. Local and national businesses that call South Florida home will now be able to better serve their customers with on-demand, same-day delivery from Dropoff.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The company will support a variety of industries throughout Miami and Fort Lauderdale, including healthcare, retail, commercial and industrial, professional services, and food and grocery, and is already working with multiple clients.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe launch into Miami and Fort Lauderdale is an exciting step for us,â said Sean Spector, CEO of Dropoff. âOur goal is to be the first national same-day delivery provider for businesses, and Florida was a logical next step in the expansion of our technology platform and 5 star-rated service. Now, Dropoff is available in all three of the most populous states in the U.S., allowing us to better serve our national and regional clients.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">After a successful expansion into California in July, Dropoff is excited to launch its service on the East Coast. At the core of Dropoffâs offerings is its proprietary technology platform, which includes web and mobile ordering capabilities, real-time tracking and confirmations, a fast, scalable, 24/7/365 dispatch automation named Intelligent Dispatch, and a feature-rich API for easy integration into clientsâ e-commerce sites or warehouse management software.</p>
