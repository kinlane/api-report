<p><a href="http://www.identitymindglobal.com">IdentityMind Global</a>, pioneer of digital identities for securing online financial transactions, today announced Identity Graph Intelligence (IGI). IGI is a key extension of IdentityMind&rsquo;s Trusted Digital Identities (TDI&trade;) API, helping identify and reduce risk through risk scoring and identity complexity analysis.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Identity Graph Intelligence uncovers complex risk and money laundering scenarios in real time by applying big data analysis to the correlation of a digital entity&rsquo;s identity attributes, transactions and behaviors. The complexity of the identity graph (diversity, depth and reputation) has a strong correlation to the risk of a transaction &mdash; the more complex the graph the higher the risk.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Trusted Digital Identities (TDI&trade;) represent online entities and their trust level in order to assess the risk of a given transaction,&rdquo; said Garrett Gafke, IdentityMind Global&rsquo;s CEO and President. &ldquo;Graph intelligence applies data science techniques to our core data model to reveal risk in highly complex scenarios where multiple entities are involved&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">IdentityMind&rsquo;s Trusted Digital Identities (TDI&trade;) are the result of carefully collecting and correlating identity data, their behaviors, and their potential affiliations to nefarious groups and activities. In many financial scenarios there are multiple entities involved or related to those entities performing a transaction. These are the scenarios where Identity Graph Intelligence is more relevant.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Organized crime attacks are sophisticated and can be devastating," said Dr. David Asher of the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance. "In my experience, they often involve multiple parties with activities that are hard to see in isolation. Graph analysis is the right tool for uncovering and stopping these complex attacks. Ultimately saving us and our customers from financial and reputational exposure."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">IdentityMind will unveil Identity Graph Intelligence technology at FinDevr Silicon Valley in October 2016 and the extended API will be available in the upcoming IdentityMind 2.0 release scheduled for November 2016.</p>
