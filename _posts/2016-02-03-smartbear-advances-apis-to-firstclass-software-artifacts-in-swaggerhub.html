<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://smartbear.com/">SmartBear Software</a></span><span class="s2">, the leader in software quality tools for the connected world, has released a major upgrade to <a href="https://swaggerhub.com/"><span class="s1">SwaggerHub</span></a>, the place for development teams to collaborate and coordinate the entire lifecycle of an API. SwaggerHub users can now create organizations and teams to organize, share and collaborate on Swagger API definitions directly in SwaggerHub, where public and private APIs are centrally and safely stored in a single, easy to use SaaS product.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;As services move toward public APIs, the value of having accessible API definitions in the <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/README.md"><span class="s1">OpenAPI Specification Format</span></a> is becoming more apparent to developers and service providers alike,&rdquo; said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonytam"><span class="s1">Tony Tam</span></a>, VP of Products, Swagger at SmartBear. &ldquo;With free and paid accounts, SwaggerHub is moving the API beyond code and into a first-class software artifact. With its robust API, end users can access their API definitions from external tools, keeping a central source-of-truth for the service interface.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> SwaggerHub allows users to discover and view public API definitions in its public registry, which contains over 2,500 APIs. During development, or for internal or sensitive services, it is often necessary to limit access to API definitions and versions. SwaggerHub now supports the ability to keep APIs private to users designated as collaborators. Inside SwaggerHub, a fine-grained access control can now be assigned to APIs.<br /> <br /> Users can also create organizations to associate their APIs and find public APIs under an organization namespace. Within the scope of an organization, teams can be created, allowing for a fine-grained association of users to logical groups. Now these teams of users can be given read-only or read-write permissions against multiple API definitions in a single step.<br /> <br /> With the rapid adoption of the <a href="http://swagger.io/"><span class="s1">Swagger Specification</span></a>, which has been donated to the <a href="https://openapis.org/"><span class="s1">Open API Initiative</span></a> under <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/"><span class="s1">The Linux Foundation</span></a>, more developers have been benefiting from the value of a contract-first API design. SwaggerHub was developed by members of the core Swagger development team with the goal of elevating the importance of design before coding and collaboration on the intent of the API.<br /> <br /> For more information on SwaggerHub, visit: <a href="https://swaggerhub.com/"><span class="s1">https://swaggerhub.com/</span></a>.<br /> <br /> <strong>About SmartBear Software</strong><br /> As the leader in software quality tools for the connected world, SmartBear supports more than four million software professionals and over 25,000 organizations in 194 countries that use its products to build and deliver the world&rsquo;s greatest applications.&nbsp;With today&rsquo;s applications deploying on mobile, Web, desktop, Internet of Things (IoT) or even embedded computing platforms, the connected nature of these applications through public and private APIs presents a unique set of challenges for developers, testers and operations teams.
