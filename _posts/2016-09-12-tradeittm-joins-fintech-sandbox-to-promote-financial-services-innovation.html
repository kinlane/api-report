These tools connect popular financial mobile apps with retail brokerage accounts and each other.</p>

FinTech Sandbox helps startups by offering free access to the data and infrastructure they need by aligning with industry-leading companies like TradeIt, thereby opening the door for advancement and innovation. Sandbox residents in return are expected to collaborate with each other, sharing learnings and advancements that benefit the FinTech ecosystem as a whole. There are no fees to participants and no equity is taken.</p>

TradeIt is ideal for Sandbox residents who are working to make mobile trading faster, safer and more secure, or who are bringing institutional-level technology and capabilities to retail investors.â</p>
