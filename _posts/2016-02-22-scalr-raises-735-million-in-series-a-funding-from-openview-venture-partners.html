<p><a href="http://www.scalr.com/">Scalr, the leading enterprise cloud management platform</a>, today announced it has closed a $7.35 million Series A round of financing, led by OpenView Venture Partners. The investment will be used to expand Scalr&rsquo;s product, with a focus on the Scalr machine and container policy engine, and to accelerate its market leadership through the expansion of its US-based sales force. Mackey Craven, Partner at OpenView who led the round, joins the Board of Directors and Jim Baum, Venture Partner at OpenView, joins as an Advisor.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;OpenView&rsquo;s deep domain expertise in the cloud computing space is precisely the reason we decided to partner with Mackey and his team,&rdquo; said Sebastian Stadil, founder and CEO of Scalr. &ldquo;Up until now, we&rsquo;ve bootstrapped our way to immense growth. Today&rsquo;s injection of capital enables Scalr to extend our reach and capabilities far beyond where they are today. We&rsquo;re looking forward to this next chapter and cementing our leadership in the cloud management space.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Since its inception, Scalr has focused on providing companies with a single point of policy management for multiple cloud platforms, and today counts among its customers the FDA, NASA, Expedia, Samsung and Accenture.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rare for a bootstrapped startup to grow so quickly in the heart of San Francisco, and is a result of solving a critical problem in enterprise IT,&rdquo; said Mackey Craven. &ldquo;Cloud adoption is transitioning from shadow IT to the office of the CIO, shining a light on the need for the governance, security, and policy enforcement that Scalr provides.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Scalr allows enterprises to govern, audit, and manage their cloud usage from a unified console, policy framework, and enforcement point. It does so with its proven solution that provides IT departments with the means to oversee and regulate an organization's use of cloud resources in private and multi-cloud environments. Three key technology-enabled approaches facilitate these governance and management benefits:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> The Scalr API and web console give transparency into what infrastructure users consume, providing critical oversight and the ability to &lsquo;trust but verify&rsquo;.</li>
<li> A robust policy framework gives IT control over cloud enforcement defining what can or cannot be done with cloud resources for compliance, security, best practices, and more.</li>
<li> Scalr embedded DevOps tools allow IT to build and provide shared services, reaping cost and time-to-market benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are in the early innings of a generational transition in enterprise IT,&rdquo; added Craven, &ldquo;and as a result the multibillion-dollar monitoring and management stack needs to be rewritten. Scalr is positioned to be one of the pillars of this new ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Scalr continues to grow both its open source community and commercial customer base, which now spans more than 400 businesses ranging from manufacturing, finance, banking, retail, technology, and government. In addition to its San Francisco headquarters, Scalr has expanded its presence to Boston, Denver, Paris, Kiev, Manila, St. Petersburg and Tel Aviv with plans to further grow its US-based sales force.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Earlier this year, Scalr added Chris C. Kemp, co-founder of OpenStack and former CTO of NASA, to its Board of Directors.</p>
