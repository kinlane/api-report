<p>Today <a href="http://www.drivecommerce.com">Drive Commerce</a> announced the availability of a certified Demandware LINK implementation for Cartographer, a guided shopping tool. This implementation, leveraging Demandware's Open Commerce API (OCAPI) instead of a traditional cartridge-based implementation, allows for rapid deployment of unique shopping experiences for Demandware clients.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Drive Commerce became a Demandware LINK partner in 2015, and introduced their suite of products at the 2015 and 2016 Xchange conferences in the US and Europe. Their goal is to support global retailers with guided shopping, product audit, and custom product software solutions. Founded by a team of eCommerce professionals leveraging their experience in solving complicated problems for global retailers, Drive will continue to develop easy-to-use, SaaS products that drive sales, and increase customer satisfaction, while maintaining the high standards required for LINK certification.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Drive Commerce's certified LINK offering, called Cartographer, allows non-technical users to combine the wealth of product data available in their product catalogs with customized questions, answers, and logical branching to create unique guided shopping experiences. Ecommerce customers can then answer simple questions using a conversational language in order to identify the best product for them. The architecture of the solution is completely customizable, but makes use of technologies like Content Assets, HTML, and Javascript, that are familiar to most Demandware clients.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"We are very excited to have been accepted by Demandware's certification review board," said Mark Barnum, founding partner of Drive Commerce. "We've launched 6 Cartographer experiences with Demandware clients in the last 6 months, and these have achieved a remarkable 22x average ROI using Cartographer. We look forward to working with even more Demandware clients who can trust that our offering is up to the standard that Demandware's clientele has come to expect."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Cartographer was the first product Drive Commerce developed as a company and will continue to evolve with regular releases. In addition to their guided shopping tool, Drive offers a growing portfolio of products targeted at catalog auditing and health, product customization, and search engine optimization.
