<p>Today, <a href="http://www.iHealthLabs.eu">iHealth Europe</a> and <a href="http://www.carespanhealth.com">CareSpan International, Inc.</a> announced the integration of iHealth&trade; consumer and iHealth Pro lines of digital health devices with the CareSpan&trade; Virtual Clinic. This integration of world-class health sensors and a complete clinical care environment represents the first telemedicine solution that meets the standards of an in-person exam with the convenience of cloud-based care delivery.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">iHealth&rsquo;s Open API relays patient data generated by iHealth products through a secure cloud interface to CareSpan&rsquo;s patient medical record system. During an online CareSpan exam, the physician or nurse communicating with a remote patient can see all of the patient&rsquo;s iHealth data such as blood pressure, blood oxygenation, blood sugar, body weight and even cardiac rhythms in the CareSpan provider interface, along with many other diagnostic data elements and images. This offers the healthcare provider an unparalleled view of patient physiology that, along with history and visual assessment, supports complete diagnosis and prescription.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We regard CareSpan as the first digital healthcare platform that presents our patient data in a unified way within a clinical workflow, designed for real-world medical care delivery,&rdquo; said Uwe Diegel, CEO of iHealthLabs Europe. &ldquo;Our vision of healthcare everywhere aligns perfectly with CareSpan&rsquo;s focus on secure cloud-based online exams that enable the practice of digital medicine and respects the medical diagnostic and continuity-of-care processes. CareSpan is also an ideal platform to test and introduce new iHealth products,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;iHealth is a pioneer in the field of FDA and CE cleared devices designed for home and clinical use that transform healthcare by capturing essential physiological data regardless of patient location,&rdquo; said Mark Winter, CEO of CareSpan. &ldquo;CareSpan, in partnership with iHealth, moves far beyond a simple video chat between a provider and patient to include the entire clinical work process needed to deliver quality healthcare. This includes iHealth data, medical images, breathing and heart sounds, even electrocardiograph charting. Our combined capabilities set the current gold standard for outpatient care delivered online.&rdquo;</p>
