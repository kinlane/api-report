<p><a href="http://boston2016.apistrat.com/schedule/">The API Strategy and Practice program has now been published on the event&rsquo;s website</a> and covers the majority of keynotes, workshops and session streams planned for the premier API conference of the year.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This year&rsquo;s program will unpack some of the key trends facing business and industry adoption of APIs and share groundbreaking new technological approaches. APIStrat&rsquo;s 2016 schedule demonstrates how APIStrat can serve as both the ideal entry point for newcomers, as well as push the envelope for industry pioneers looking to the next frontier.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really excited by this year&rsquo;s program,&rdquo; said Lorinda Brandon, APIStrat Program Chair. &ldquo;Every year I hear participants say that the most difficult thing about APIStrat is deciding which session tracks to attend, as there is always so much great content. So I&rsquo;m really proud that our Program Committee and organizing team has made this year&rsquo;s choices tougher than ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Brandon accredits the Session Chairs in particular &mdash; each one an industry thought leader in their specific field. &ldquo;Our Session Chairs have helped shape a program that will provide newcomers with an overview of key API topics, including API design, developer relations, security, and enterprise API usage. They have also invited speakers for each of their sessions that are the cutting edge of where we are headed next, so it is a great mix of bringing everyone up to date and pushing all forward to do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This year&rsquo;s program includes:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Keynotes from industry leaders covering the latest trends and advances. Leading Industry analyst Mark O&rsquo;Neill will open the conference with a deep-dive into how industry is taking up the API advantage and where he sees the next biggest opportunities and threats for business stakeholders and API service providers. Susan Danziger from Ziggeo will share an insider perspective on how to design and grow an API business model. Sarah Jeong will walk the audience through key events of the precedent-setting Google vs Oracle API copyright case, and Charles Ashley will detail practical strategies to redress employment inequalities in the API workforce.</li>
<li>Mainstage panels include a look at the media industry with Chris Caen (ReadWrite), Christine Mitchell (Discovery) David Berlind (ProgrammableWeb) and Tyler Love (from new media juggernaut Bustle). This panel talk will discuss how a traditional industry like media is being fundamentally reimagined with APIs and will provide insights for any industry struggling with how to adapt to the disruptive force of APIs.</li>
<li>Session streams take conversations that commenced at APIStrat Austin in 2015 to the next level with new streams focused on two of the biggest trends seen in API practice: the move towards a product management approach for APIs and a look at the way APIs are being used by non-programmers. Both have been topics demanded by APIStrat audiences in the past year. Technical talks continue to advance the understanding in key themes including microservices, hypermedia and data science.</li>
<li>Workshops will be provide hands-on opportunities to experiment with API technologies including those from StrongLoop, 3scale, and the Open API Initiative.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;APIStrat is successful because it is made up of an impressive lineup of speakers and an equally vibrant, engaged community of attendees,&rdquo; said APIStrat co-organizer, Steven Willmott and previous CEO of 3scale. &ldquo;We are excited by our Boston program as it will bring together world-class presentations with our engaged and community-driven audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Seeing the program come together this year has been an inspiration,&rdquo; said co-organizer API Evangelist, Kin Lane. &ldquo;It reflects many of the conversations I have every day with practitioners in business, government and startups who are looking for ways to use APIs to strengthen connections and to encourage a new model of co-creation and engagement between service users and service producers.&rdquo;</p>
