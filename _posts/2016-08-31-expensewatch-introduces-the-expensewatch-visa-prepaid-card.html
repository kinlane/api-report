<p><a href="http://www.ExpenseWatch.com">ExpenseWatch</a>, a leader in spend control solutions, today announced the launch of the ExpenseWatch Visa Prepaid Card in partnership with PEX, the leading platform provider of next-generation corporate card and expense management solutions. The ExpenseWatch Card gives companies the ability to provide employees with a way to make purchases as needed, while allowing company administrators the ability to set spending limits and control where cards are used.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to partner with PEX to offer this new expense management tool to our customers,&rdquo; said Paul Thedinga, Vice President of Strategic Alliances for ExpenseWatch. &ldquo;This card provides our customers with a better alternative for making funds available to their employees who need them, while giving administrators front-end control over every dollar spent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Customers can log in to the ExpenseWatch web application to monitor and manage the prepaid card program. Administrators can direct money to employees as needed without them having to use cash out of their own pocket, get a blank check, or use personal credit cards and wait for reimbursement. Administrators can also set controls on where and when company funds can be spent, and get real-time visibility into overall spending. Employees can now easily purchase the items they need in order to complete their job without using their own funds and the purchases will appear in ExpenseWatch so they can be added to an expense report with ease.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;PEX and ExpenseWatch have a shared vision for bringing time and money-saving solutions to help companies be efficient and smart with their purchasing,&rdquo; said Toffer Grant, CEO of PEX. &ldquo;Our platform enables the ExpenseWatch Visa Prepaid Card to integrate easily with the expense reporting and purchasing tools already offered by ExpenseWatch.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ExpenseWatch is offering the card program at no additional cost to existing customers. Visit pcard.expensewatch.com to learn more about the card and enroll in the program.</p>
