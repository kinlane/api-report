<p>The <a href="http://genability.com/">energy data API platform Genability</a> is "instituting a new support notification process" to ensure API developers "receive timely notification of issues, outages and status of the Genability API and web applications&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Genability will update API developers with:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Notification When API Outages Occur</li>
<li>Periodic Updates During API Outages</li>
<li>Notification When Things Are Back Normal</li>
<li>A Post-Mortem When They Know What Happened</li>
</ul>
<p>You can receive notifications via email, and Genability separates issues by API and application, helping developers prioritize, based upon the individual issue.</p>
<p>A proactive API issue notification system is something more APIs are implementing to help support developers, and strengthen the feedback loop with API consumers.</p>
