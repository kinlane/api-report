<p>Continuum<sup>&reg;</sup>, the only channel-exclusive IT management platform company, and IT Glue&trade;, a proven, best practices-driven IT documentation platform packed with features designed to help MSPs reduce waste and maximize profit, are now integrated where IT Glue connects with Continuum&rsquo;s Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) platform. Now, when MSPs create client facing documents or reports, they can easily include Continuum asset data.</p>
<p>By leveraging IT Glue&rsquo;s powerful documentation platform, MSPs are able to document both structured (network information, domains, passwords or software licensing) and procedural (knowledge base and SOPs) information. This is integrated seamlessly with asset information provided by Continuum&rsquo;s RMM, making it very fast for engineers to find the information they need to complete work efficiently and accurately for clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Documentation is a vital component to sharing knowledge within teams and organizations, but it habitually becomes stale and inaccurate,&rdquo; said Donnie Berkholz, Research Director for Development, DevOps and IT Ops at 451 Research. &ldquo;By making it easier to avoid outdated, invalid information about IT assets through a direct API integration, this partnership aims to save customers time and money with improved efficiency, while also shortening the troubleshooting process during critical downtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This deep integration pulls key data sets for Continuum into IT Glue where MSPs can access information such as memory, disk, CPU and more directly into IT Glue. The integration provides a number of benefits, including assessing near real-time information, eliminating the need to enter configuration data manually, minimizing downtime by reducing the time it takes to troubleshoot problems as well as enhancing team performance by having more data in one place. The integration leverages the new Continuum Reporting API now available which allows vendors to obtain raw reporting data from Continuum to build custom reports in-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of our partners have indicated that they would like to utilize IT Glue, a highly regarded point solution for MSPs, to author and maintain IT documentation of their clients, in conjunction with Continuum,&rdquo; said Carl Resnik, Senior Director, Product Management at Continuum. &ldquo;We are excited to deliver this integration where our partners can now have their device information from Continuum appear in IT Glue to quickly reference in their documentation, increasing their efficiency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Integrating IT Glue with Continuum has given us an unprecedented insight into the devices we manage on the same platform that we use daily for documentation,&rdquo; said Caleb Albers, System Administrator at Keystone IT. &ldquo;It has offered us the unique ability to self-document a lot of clients without having to manually populate fields that quickly become out-of-date. IT Glue&rsquo;s structured system, combined with the high level of detail that Continuum already has on our clients&rsquo; networks, means that we are able to have a 360 degree view of clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Ash Creek Enterprises, we are extremely excited about this announcement and integration as it will further increase our possibilities for efficiencies and streamline our integration between IT Glue and Continuum to further our relationship with our partnerships and exceed our SLA&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mark Calzone, President at Ash Creek Enterprises.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This integration will allow us to make sure our documentation remains synchronized and consistent throughout all tools that we use to provide the best service possible for our clients,&rdquo; said Frank Roberts, Director of Network Services at Karpel Solutions. &ldquo;The setup was simple and very easy to remediate any inconsistencies between IT Glue configurations and Continuum monitored devices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By helping to standardize and store complete IT documentation in one place, teams have rapid access to IT asset information helping to maximize efficiency, transparency and consistency of teams. IT Glue provides people with the confidence and trust that IT assets and procedures are documented properly. For more information, visit: https://www.itglue.com/.</p>
