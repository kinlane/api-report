As of August 8, 2014, the following updates will be implemented:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>A clear explanation of the data we collect</li>
<li>Assurance that the data is not linked to any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) </li>
<li>How the anonymous data we collect will be shared</li>
<li>The privacy policy includes a link to the Consumer Choice opt-out page on our website so that you can manage all of your browser opt out preferences</li>
<li>We are committed to keeping Bitly&rsquo;s free services available to all users. However it&rsquo;s important to continue to offer the services they have come to love while still being able to thrive as a business.</li>
