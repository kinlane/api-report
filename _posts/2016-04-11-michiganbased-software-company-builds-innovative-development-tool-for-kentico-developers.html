<p><a href="http://www.bizstream.com">BizStream</a>, a software company specializing in web design, development, and custom software, announced today a new development tool available to Kentico developers. Working to solve an ongoing issue, BizStream built COMPARE for Kentico to ease website deployments. The tool visually shows developers if website page content, code, media, and more, are in sync across Kentico installations. COMPARE for Kentico is now available to the entire Kentico user base and developer community.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s websites and web applications are complex entities that have many moving parts, and without some level of automation, it is too easy to miss a line of code here, or database object there, when it comes to deploying to production,&rdquo; said Brian McKeiver, Co-Owner at BizStream. &ldquo;We got tired of missing something trivial or overwriting code from another development team and decided there had to be a better way. That is really why we built Compare for Kentico.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">COMPARE for Kentico was borne out of the challenge of deploying changes in Kentico multi-environment projects. When components are determined to be out of sync, developers can quickly determine if these differences are intentional or not.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">COMPARE for Kentico is the first tool available in the BizStream Toolkit - a planned suite of tools for Kentico developers to assist with building, maintaining, and enhancing Kentico projects. COMPARE for Kentico features a 30-day free trial, with pricing starting at $299 USD per month. Learn more at http://www.bizstreamtoolkit.com/</p>
