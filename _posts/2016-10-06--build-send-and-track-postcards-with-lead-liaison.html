<p>It&rsquo;s a match made in heaven. The marketing automation powerhouse Lead Liaison has partnered with Lob, a company that is aggressively building a suite of APIs that allow businesses to build applications within their own software for offline marketing tools. Together, they have created an integration that allows marketers to build, send, and track postcards within Lead Liaison&rsquo;s software platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"A marketing automation solution should make your life easier, not more difficult. Lead Liaison and Lob share that goal, which is why we were excited to partner with them on this project. Their postcard builder is intuitive, which allows users to spend less time learning how to use it and more time creating exciting and valuable content." - Shrav Mehta, Growth Engineer at Lob</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Here are some highlights of the integration:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Flexible Design </strong><br />Custom postcards can be built from scratch or from pre-designed templates in the platform. Users can add their own images, colors, and fonts. The interface allows users to choose between various postcard sizes, such as 4 x 6, 6 x 9, and 6 x 11, and customize both front and back designs. Drag-and-drop technology allows users to easily design a postcard in minutes, not hours.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Dynamic Data Insertion </strong><br />The new Lead Liaison Postcard Builder gives users the ability to insert standard or custom fields as dynamic text inside of their postcards. This option allows information to be added to each postcard based on the recipient&rsquo;s data in their prospect profile. The ability to include relevant data that&rsquo;s specific to the recipient transforms offline marketing into personalized marketing. Companies can better use personalized data for account based marketing (ABM) or one-to-one marketing.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Send on Demand with Flexible Delivery Options </strong><br />Flexible delivery options minimizes costs. Users no longer need to hit a minimum number of recipients. Send a one-off postcard wishing clients a &ldquo;Happy Birthday!&rdquo;, send multiple postcards to a list of people, or include as an action in automated drip marketing.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Folders &amp; Cloning </strong><br />What&rsquo;s the use of valuable content if you can&rsquo;t find it when you need it? Lead Liaison recently released a new feature that allows users to organize their content, personalizations, and automations into folders. Once marketers have identified valuable content, Lead Liaison&rsquo;s powerful software provides to ability to clone it, saving valuable time.</p>
