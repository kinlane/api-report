<p><a href="http://www.virsera.com">Virsera</a>, an enterprise business gamification company, today announced the worldwide release of SpurGo Pro.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With a recent Gallup Poll showing over two-thirds of the national workforce reporting as &lsquo;disengaged&rsquo; from their job, the purpose of SpurGo is to re-motivate employees to drive their business forward faster, with more fun. The outcome is objective, real-time, and historical player performance with quantifiable business results.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;After great initial success with SpurGo, we leveraged customer usage patterns to inform our next set of features, which resulted in greater ability to engage employees and increased ease of use within the product,&rdquo; said John Diefendorf, co-founder of Virsera. &ldquo;Enterprise customers are now able to track and engage more easily and really drive the behaviors they most want to reward with their employees and partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To date, Virsera counts Microsoft, Citrix, Aon Hewitt, Polycom, Nextgen Distribution and Symantec among their largest customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>A Flexible Platform, with or without integration </strong><br />While most gamification solutions require technical integration into existing CRM, Directory or other systems, SpurGo Pro offers the ability to work completely stand-alone. The platform allows game hosts to create any type of task, provide real-time/historical reporting, in-game communications, custom UI enhancements, and grading methodologies without having to tie into back-end services. This allows the user create a game in minutes without having to work with IT to tie into specific internal or external data sources.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;One of the biggest selling points with our enterprise customers is how quickly they can get going,&rdquo; said Joe Corella, co-founder of Virsera. &ldquo;My typical sales call entails setting up a customer&rsquo;s first game within the first 30 minutes of the meeting and launching it. I can see the relief on my customers faces when they realize that they can gamify any kind of task and IT doesn&rsquo;t need to get involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">While not required, SpurGo Pro now offers complete integration with back-end services such as Saleforce.com, Microsoft Dynamics, and HubSpot for automated task completion recording and Microsoft Active Directory and oauth for federated single sign on. &ldquo;If you have an API that we can read from, we can populate the leaderboard,&rdquo; said Teodor Stefanut, lead developer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Engage Your Partners to Drive Your Business </strong><br />Additionally, Virsera now offers the added benefit of allowing companies to white-label SpurGo Pro with their logos and branding enabling them to gamify their partner ecosystems with external player support. &ldquo;Working with SpurGo has allowed us to engage our partner ecosystem in a new and exciting way. We have been able to customize the game so that it aligns with our vendors and allows us to play a unique and highly influential role in driving certain behaviors and outcomes. The platform is easy to use and very powerful but most importantly it&rsquo;s fun and cool.&rdquo; said Scott Caulfield, Managing Director at Nextgen Distribution. With SpurGo Pro engaging partners, customers now have a branded and customized platform where partners can engage, compete and semi-anonymously view how they rank in performance compared to their peers in a given segment, region or specialty. This is driving increased partner performance and more strategic partner funding decisions from our customers.</p>
