<p><a href="http://www.dlt.com/">DLT Solutions (DLT)</a>, a leading public sector technology company, and Nutonian Inc., the machine intelligence company, today announced their partnership focused on providing data science solutions to the public sector. Nutonian&rsquo;s A.I.-powered modeling engine, Eureqa&reg;, automatically builds and interprets predictive models, and will help agencies address the rapidly growing demand for data science skills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Nutonian. DLT has a long history of introducing innovative technologies into the public sector and this announcement carries on that tradition,&rdquo; said Alan Marc Smith, president and CEO, DLT. &ldquo;We look forward to working with Nutonian to meet their goal of being a leader in data science in the public sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eureqa is the first and only artificial intelligence that can identify cause and effect relationships within complex data structures. It makes data science initiatives easier, faster and more precise by automatically discovering the simplest possible predictive and analytical models that characterize a data set. Eureqa features:</p>
<p><strong>Infinite scalability</strong>: Tap into unlimited CPU resources to linearly scale compute and accelerate data science projects without having to provision new hardware or administer cloud servers.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning fast solutions</strong>: Eureqa tests billions of potential models per second to identify those that best fit your data.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic signal discovery</strong>: Capture, combine, or transform important variables into features. Shift the focus from &ldquo;big data&rdquo; to the &ldquo;right data.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Shareable results</strong>: Share data and model outputs across the team or agency</p>
<p><strong>API access</strong>: Tap directly into live data streams, interface with visualization tools, and integrate with existing analyses in various formats.</p>
<p>"DLT was high on our priority list of initial partnerships," said Michael Schmidt, Nutonian's founder and CTO. "If we want to be the market leaders in A.I. and data science, we've got to hit the industries where we can have the biggest impact. The public sector is ripe for innovation &ndash; they collect troves of data, with billions of dollars and insights latent within it. Together, DLT and Nutonian are going to make that value real."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nutonian is revolutionizing the way we interpret data,&rdquo; said Brian Strosser, COO, DLT. &ldquo;The public sector is rich in data, however the time and trained talent to mine its value is lacking. As DLT continues to help the public sector solve IT challenges, Eureqa will help agencies extract meaning from their data chaos.&rdquo;</p>
