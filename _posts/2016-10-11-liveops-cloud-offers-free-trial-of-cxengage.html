<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/liveops_logo@2x.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /><a href="http://www.liveopscloud.com">LiveOps Cloud</a>, a leading contact center-as-a-service (CCaaS) provider,        today announced a free trial of CxEngage, an always-on, highly secure,        true multi-tenant and instantly scalable CCaaS platform. The 30-day free        trial program allows organizations a risk-free opportunity to explore        the value of CxEngage firsthand, realize the power of a cloud-based        contact center and transform their customer service operations and        customer experiences from day one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The contact center is on the brink of a major transformation - faced        with aging infrastructure, outdated software and budget constraints,        organizations are turning to cloud-based solutions to provide the        flexibility and quality required for unparalleled customer service at a        time when it is more important than ever before,&rdquo; said Jeff Thompson,        CTO. &ldquo;The very nature of software-as-a-service demands that customers        have the ability to try before they buy, which CxEngage makes easy. From        the onset of the 30-day trial, customers will experience the immediate        ease of deployment, the openness of our API-first architecture and the        scalability of our global, true cloud platform &ndash; all with no risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the features and functionality of the CxEngage platform, including a        smart agent toolbar, data exchange, real-time dashboards, historical        reporting, instant provisioning, flow authoring and much more, are        available as part of the free trial. Trial customers will have access to        CxEngage and all APIs to customize their system for a 30-day period.        Training and technical documentation will be provided, along with a        dedicated LiveOps Cloud resource who will help define the customer&rsquo;s        goals, desired outcomes and how to measure success with CxEngage.</p>
<p>Launched earlier this year, tens of thousands of users are already        providing exceptional customer experiences with CxEngage and        organizations are seeing immediate value through services that support        agents across the globe while allowing an improved level of management        and supervision over on-premises solutions. The LiveOps Cloud CxEngage        Platform runs on Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) and offers the        flexibility, reliability and scalability global organizations of all        sizes need to service their customers anywhere, anytime. Designed for        effortless administration and informed performance, CxEngage integrates        with a broad set of applications such as customer relationship        management (CRM), workforce management (WFM) and business intelligence        (BI) to perpetually improve global service delivery.</p>
