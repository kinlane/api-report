<p class="responsiveNews">With an AgentSquared IDX website powered by the robust Spark API, real estate agents are now empowered to create a modern branded, responsive IDX website, register their domain, include searchable property listings, and much more and have a live website in minutes. Within one week, Flexmls System Users will be able to simply click on the Spark icon in their Flexmls system to build their own mobile-friendly AgentSquared IDX website. Agents can also tie-in their social media pages for instant promotion via automated postings, capture and organize leads, save customer searches and favorite homes, and send local information about school districts and businesses. AgentSquared IDX websites are updated instantly via the Spark API once any information changes.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Other IDX website solutions cost hundreds to thousands of dollars to set up. Between gathering content, entering data, creating the website, and faxing documents back forth between the broker, MLS, and IDX vendor, getting an IDX website built, up and running can take days or in some markets, weeks. Once live, those solutions often use a data feed that does not have live data while containing duplicate or inaccurate information that can be days old.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âFlexmls is an innovative company, and Spark is a powerful platform that has allowed us to innovate a truly instant IDX agent website product, something we believe hasnât existed until now,â said Troy McCasland, CEO of AgentSquared. âThe process of creating IDX compliant websites capable of displaying other broker's listings is a highly regulated and complex process, as each state and every individual MLS has their own rules and requirements. The Spark API simplifies that process while ensuring all rules are followed saving the MLS and the Agent both time and resources.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âAgentSquared has done a great job utilizing the Spark API to deliver a much-needed IDX website solution,â said Kim Prior, Vice President of Marketing of FBS, creator of Flexmls and Spark. âCreating an IDX website can be a time consuming event with hidden fees and it shouldnât be. The AgentSquared product makes it easy saving time, energy and money while delivering a beautiful, modern website with the most timely and accurate listing data available via Spark. Weâre excited that our Flexmls System Users will soon have access through the Spark Storeâ</p>
