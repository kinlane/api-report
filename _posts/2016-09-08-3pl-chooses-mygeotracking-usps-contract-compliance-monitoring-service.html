<p><a href="http://abaqus.net/">Abaqus, Inc.</a>, a provider of the innovative myGeoTracking Software-as-a-Service location and messaging platform for Supply Chain Logistics and mobile workforce management today announced that FLS Transportation Services &ndash; an industry leading multinational third-party logistics company - has chosen myGeoTracking to fully automated its 3rd party driver &amp; load management operations to help it cost-effectively comply with USPS GPS location reporting requirements for mail route contracts, and expand its business.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Shannon Kerr, Branch Director at FLS Transportation said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really pleased to be working with myGeoTracking to support our growing USPS freight contract practice. As a third party logistics provider, FLS Transportation works with a handful of strategic carrier partners to meet our customers' needs. This became a challenge as we expanded our USPS practice and were required to meet strict USPS Logistics reporting requirements for an increasing number of very complex HCR routes with multi-stops and multi-day runs. How would we get GPS and Logistics Intelligence data on a truck where we had no visibility into its in-cab GPS equipment and where 'no set route to set truck' assignment was in place?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The company launched a determined search looking for a one-stop solution that could help meet the USPS location tracking mandate for their US Postal Highway contract routes (HCR) and as well as provide real-time logistics intelligence &amp; alerts to help streamline operations &amp; speed up response times.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;After evaluating several options we chose to implement myGeoTracking&rsquo;s USPS compliance reporting system,&rdquo; continued Kerr. &ldquo;Now it doesn&rsquo;t matter what equipment is in use by which carrier, myGeoTracking bypasses that and taps the driver&rsquo;s own smartphone with a clever, powerful app and platform to track the USPS load on a very dynamic basis across a changing pool of drivers and vehicles from a number of carrier partners. Not only can we always get the USPS compliance reporting we need, are also providing our USPS contract officers with total visibility &ndash; real time location with map views, geo-fenced arrival and departure alerts and records, and other important status information.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"We&rsquo;re very excited to be working with FLS to help them meet their needs," said Shailendra Jain, CEO of Abaqus, Inc. &ldquo;Most of their USPS contracts involved complex routes with multi-stops and multi-day runs with strict arrival / departure SLAs at postal facilities along the route. That&rsquo;s where the power of the myGeoTracking platform&rsquo;s comprehensive and flexible rules IFTT engine and tracking automation tools come into full play &ndash; so no matter how many contract stops, how many drivers on a team, or how many relays involved, myGeoTracking provides FLS with seamless reporting to the USPS with minimal driver input. In fact, all the drivers need to do is simply download our USPS compliance app and drive the route assigned them by their dispatcher &ndash; our highly automated system takes care of the rest.&rdquo;</p>
