<p><a href="http://www.homecaresoftware.com">Generations</a>, a leader in cloud based software for homecare agencies, released Integrated Mapping and Routing into its powerful Caregiver Search module. This new integration enables homecare agencies to service clients with greater efficiency while reducing caregiver travel time, thereby controlling the cost of service.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Reducing cost is important, but when you can help the agency reduce cost and increase client service at the same time, it's a winning combination", said Lance Ferden, President at Integrated Database Systems.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Agencies that are conscientious about minimizing travel time for their caregivers will enjoy a high level of satisfaction from their work force which, in turn, leads to less turnover and greater client retention.", says Lisa Ferden, Vice President and co-owner of Integrated Database Systems.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new integration is provided as a free service to Generations customers via licensing with Google Maps API. For more information on Generations Homecare System please visit <a href="http://www.homecaresoftware.com">http://www.homecaresoftware.com</a>.</p>
