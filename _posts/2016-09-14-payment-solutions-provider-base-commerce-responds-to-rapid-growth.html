<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_84861_david_schoenecker.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.basecommerce.com">Base Commerce</a>, a leading provider of advanced payment solutions, has announced the addition of David Schoenecker and Anna Lam to its executive team. Chief marketing officer and vice president of sales respectively, they will be charged with using the companyâs strong momentum to achieve national recognition as a premiere technology company and innovator in the payments industry.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Schoenecker has nearly 20 years of marketing and business development experience, having built and managed a thriving marketing firm with clients in a wide range of industries. An expert in marketing strategy, he will be crafting the marketing plan for Base Commerce on what is effectively a blank slate, as the company has achieved its significant success to date with little formal marketing. He will also oversee the companyâs expanding sales operations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe challenge before me and my team is unique and exciting: to take innovative payment technologies that are unlike any other on the market and highly regarded by industry insiders, but as yet unknown to many in our business, and create the awareness that propels this company into the national spotlight,â said Schoenecker. âBase Commerce has undergone a great deal of very positive change in the past few years, and Iâm thrilled to be working with such a talented, focused, and respected executive team.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Lam has a track record of success in sales and customer service spanning more than 25 years. It includes work for a multi-million dollar retail medical operation and more recently as a top producer in sales and client retention for a leading U.S. payments processor. Initiatives she has spearheaded have led to double-digit sales growth and record profitability for her prior employers. She will be tasked with directing all sales efforts.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe payments industry is changing more rapidly than ever, and Iâm excited to be working for a company that is the unquestioned leader in that evolution,â said Lam. âOne of my responsibilities will be to oversee relationships with our clients. Iâm looking forward to that interaction and the feedback that will continue to drive enhancements to our products.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe addition of David and Anna to our team will bring a wealth of talent and experience to our marketing and sales operations,â said Base Commerce President Brian Bonfiglio. âTheir expertise will help us channel the growing interest in our payment solutions into focused conversations about our offerings that lead to new client relationships. Weâre very happy to have them onboard.â</p>
