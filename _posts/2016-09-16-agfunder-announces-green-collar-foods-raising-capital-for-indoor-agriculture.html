The company is in the controlled environment agriculture (CEA) sector and deploying an innovative network of franchised inner-city farming facilities. The GCF vision is to empower inner-city farmers with an affordable CEA business solution that is technologically intuitive and financially profitable.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Green Collar Foods leverages its technology platform, which combines Microsoft Azureâs IoT suite with GCFâs centralized machine learning platform and proprietary farm management software to create the GCF AgCloud. The platform streams data from sensors and open-source APIs to connect, monitor, and control a network of indoor farms. This enables continuous learning for GCF and its clients to extract efficiencies, record plant recipes and improve yields. The GCF AgCloud was built in collaboration with technology partner and investor Shaping Cloud.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The main aim of this technology is to enable anyone to operate an inner-city indoor farm while continuously learning from the process. GCF is passionate about democratizing inner-city CEA along with increasing the sustainability of each new location.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe want to create real impact in the inner-city communities we are targeting, instead of talking about food desert-amelioration policies that ignore the real factors like lower levels of income and education. Therefore, we believe the best way towards an impact strategy is to give people ownership in fresh food production facilities â hence creating jobs, teaching usable STEM technology skills, all while building economic value,â said Ron Reynolds, Chairman and co-founder at Green Collar Foods.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">GCF has a pipeline of facilities set for construction across the US and the UK including five GCF Hubs in its 1-year development pipeline across the US and UK. Integral to its rollout strategy, the company has partnered with major local land-grant universities, both as long-term food purchase customers, and low cost providers of research and support. These institutions include Florida A&M University, University of Connecticut and the University of Sheffield in England.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">In the next five years GCF plans to create 130 new inner city jobs and redevelop 200,000 sqft of blighted urban infrastructure, by supplying thousands of pounds of high-value specialty crops to local institutional customers and generating strong returns for investors.</p>
