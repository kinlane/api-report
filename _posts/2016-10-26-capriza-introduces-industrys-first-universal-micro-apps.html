<p><a href="http://www.capriza.com">Capriza</a>, a leader in enterprise mobility for business applications, today announced its latest release, Falcon, introducing the industry&rsquo;s first set of Universal Micro Apps designed to reduce the time it takes organizations to deliver value through enterprise mobility. As opposed to siloed approaches,&nbsp;Capriza&rsquo;s&nbsp;pre-built micro apps uniquely work across widely-varied business applications, simplifying and accelerating&nbsp;high valueprocesses.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Falcon was inspired by the challenges businesses face in identifying where to apply mobility to achieve the fastest time to value, how to leverage their enormous investments in business applications that were not designed for the modern mobile&nbsp;workplace,&nbsp;and the knowledge gap most organizations face in creating user-centric mobile experiences. Furthermore, Gartner has predicted&nbsp;that,&nbsp;"Through 2017, the market capacity for mobile application development services will grow at least five times faster than internal IT organization capacity to deliver them.&rdquo;1</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Falcon&rsquo;s Universal Micro Apps enable organizations to overcome these obstacles by embedding best practices developed with&nbsp;Capriza&rsquo;senterprise customers, spanning over 30 industries and 500,000 users. These pre-built micro apps provide immediate impact and business value across multiple line segments and can be quickly attached to any web-based business application.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Typical businesses operate via hundreds of processes that happen on any given day. Friction in those processes can compound, impacting business agility. While many are fundamental and necessary for governance and compliance, they can be a significant contributor to operational drag.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Universal Micro Apps are initially available for a wide range of common approvals processes, including purchase orders, requisitions, invoices, expenses, and time-off. The new micro apps simplify, mobilize, and accelerate these approval processes so that employees can purchase goods or services to keep the business running, or invoice customers faster to accelerate time-to-cash.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We have hundreds of managers working at remote sites who need to approve purchase orders for materials to keep our projects moving. In one month alone, a district manager spent over 33 hours approving 800 POs,&rdquo; said Kent Lyon, Vice President, Finance for RPC, a leading oilfield services company. &ldquo;The accumulative impact of approvals across the entire organization takes a major toll on our productivity, creating significant operational drag. With&nbsp;Capriza, we&rsquo;ve been able to eliminate that burden and reduce approval cycle times by more than 75 percent. From a compliance standpoint, this ensures peace of mind, while providing a quick and consistent mobile user experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Key capabilities of Universal Micro Apps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>User-First Mobile Design &ndash; Using mobile design best practices, the micro apps are simple and intuitive and leverage native mobile capabilities. They also include optimized workflows allowing users to quickly review the information needed to make an informed decision for a specific approval. By providing a consistent, unified experience for the different types of approvals, users are shielded from the nuances and complexities of the underlying applications to maximize productivity and minimize delays.</li>
<li>Attach to Any Web-Based Business Application &ndash; Universal Micro Apps can quickly attach to any web-based business application using point and click functionality &ndash; without the need for upgrades, coding, APIs, systems integration, or any new infrastructure.</li>
<li>Proactive Updates &ndash; Widespread consumer adoption of mobility has created a pervasive expectation that apps should notify the userwith&nbsp;important updates. By continuously monitoring any field-level data from any business application, Universal Micro Apps proactively alert the user through push notifications based on business conditions. The system also highlights critical metrics though swipeable widgets, so users have ready access to information when they need it.</li>
<li>Optimized Experience &ndash;&nbsp;Capriza&nbsp;Falcon uses numerous performance optimization techniques such as caching, lazy loading, and pre-fetching to achieve maximum app responsiveness. In some instances, the performance of the Universal Micro Apps can be faster than the underlying business application itself.</li>
<li>Fully Extensible &ndash; Universal Micro Apps are fully configurable, enabling business owners to rebrand and restyle them, as well as add new fields, controls, screens, or even steps in the workflow with no coding required.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Pre-built micro apps from&nbsp;Capriza&nbsp;can help companies deploy more quickly, without &lsquo;reinventing the wheel&rsquo; in terms of user experience,&rdquo; said Brennan Sullivan, CIO at Allscripts. &ldquo;Rather than spending cycles trying to design mobile apps, my team can focus on what we know best: our employees&rsquo; needs, our processes in Oracle EBS, Salesforce.com, and others, and how to use&nbsp;Capriza&nbsp;to deliver a user-centric experience to connect them for maximum business impact.&rdquo;</p>
