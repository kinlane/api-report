<p><a href="http://sqrrl.com">Sqrrl launched Sqrrl Threat Hunting App for QRadar,</a> which integrates with IBM security intelligence technology to empower security analysts to become skilled threat hunters.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Threat hunting is the proactive and iterative search for threats that have evaded other security defenses. A recent SANS Institute survey identified that 86% of security organizations are now threat hunting using a variety of exploratory and algorithmic data analysis techniques. Sqrrl is an established market leader for threat hunting and is the first purpose-built platform for threat hunting.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new application is freely available to the security community through IBM Security App Exchange, a marketplace where developers across the industry can share applications based on IBM Security technologies. As threats are evolving faster than ever, collaborative development amongst the security community will help organizations adapt quickly and speed innovation in the fight against cybercrime.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sqrrl Threat Hunting App for QRadar integrates with IBM Security QRadar, the company&rsquo;s security intelligence platform, which analyzes data across an organization&rsquo;s IT infrastructure in real-time to identify potential security threats. Leveraging QRadar&rsquo;s new open application programming interfaces (API), Sqrrl Threat Hunting App for QRadar allows Sqrrl and IBM customers to easily pivot from QRadar into Sqrrl&rsquo;s intuitive, graphical interface for contextualizing and exploring QRadar alerts. Users will also benefit from Sqrrl&rsquo;s kill chain-focused User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA). These machine learning-powered analytics provide greater context and focus to hunts.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The SIEM is an important, foundational tool in security operations centers, and the combination of Sqrrl plus IBM Security QRadar makes it easier to start hunting and detect advanced threats,&rdquo; said Sqrrl CEO, Mark Terenzoni. &ldquo;Sqrrl&rsquo;s Integration with IBM Security QRadar allows customers to get even more value out of their market leading SIEM.&rdquo;</p>
