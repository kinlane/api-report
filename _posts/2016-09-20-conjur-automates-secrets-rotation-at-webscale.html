<p>&ldquo;Secrets&rdquo; are credentials such as passwords and API keys that provide privileged access to IT systems. Secrets need to be changed, or &ldquo;rotated&rdquo; periodically, sometimes daily, in order to help prevent unauthorized access to systems.</p>
<p>Incorporated into the <a href="http://www.conjur.net">Conjur</a> privileged access management software, Secrets Rotation, Automation and Monitoring offloads the secrets management burden from DevOps and software developers, and provides companies with a clear view into compliance with secrets rotation policies. Clients can simply log&nbsp;in to&nbsp;their&nbsp;Conjur&nbsp;dashboard to view the rotations and schedule and rotate on demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secrets management is a security best practice that absolutely requires automation given the scale and complexity of today&rsquo;s digital business systems,&rdquo; said Elizabeth Lawler, CEO of&nbsp;Conjur. &ldquo;Without clear insights into when secrets are rotating, and confirmation that rotations have occurred without failure, it&rsquo;s virtually impossible to confirm that you&rsquo;re compliant&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and that your information is safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secrets management is a critical aspect of security, but current solutions lack clear visibility into rotation history.&nbsp;Conjur&nbsp;alerts to rotation failures, and the intuitive user interface design makes it simple for clients to produce an audit trail to demonstrate compliance.</p>
<p>Secrets rotation is an element of security best practices, but managing it can be expensive when you&rsquo;re talking about digital business systems composed of thousands of interconnected cloud instances, microservices, databases, and other system entities. With policy-driven automation of secrets rotation, a simple dashboard and clear insights into secrets management,&nbsp;Conjur&nbsp;is taking the risk and guesswork out of compliance, allowing clients to focus on delivering the best user experience to customers, rather than system administration and worrying about digging through data to produce proof of compliance.</p>
<p>Secrets Rotation,&nbsp;Automation&nbsp;and Monitoring is currently available to&nbsp;Conjur&nbsp;clients and integrates to secure a wide variety of legacy and cloud resources.</p>
