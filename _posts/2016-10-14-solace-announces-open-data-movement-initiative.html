<p>Solace, the leading provider of data movement technology, announced today a set of product enhancements and strategic commitments that reflect a corporate initiative called Open Data Movement which will give developers unprecedented freedom as they design, deploy, connect and scale enterprise applications, big data systems, cloud services and Internet of Things projects.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The crux of Open Data Movement is unified support for all of the tools and techniques people use to create the application infrastructure that drives their unique business practices,&rdquo; said Solace CTO Shawn McAllister. &ldquo;We are on a path that leads to unified support for every open API, protocol and cloud environment that people care about, all with enterprise grade reliability.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Today Solace unveiled nine new product and company announcements in support of the Open Data Movement initiative:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>AMQP 1.0 and Apache Qpid Support: Solace message routers will support AMQP 1.0, the first open standard protocol for enterprise-class messaging, by early 2017. Solace&rsquo;s support for AMQP 1.0 will include certified interoperability with existing Apache Qpid APIs. Solace will continue to participate in the evolution of the AMQP 1.0 protocol as a member of the OASIS working group.</li>
<li>Additional Cloud Support: Over the coming months, Solace will expand its already robust cloud support by adding support for Microsoft Azure, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, RedHat OpenShift and IBM BlueMix.</li>
<li>Pivotal Cloud Foundry Tile: A Pivotal Cloud Foundry tile that offers easy access to Solace messaging capabilities is now available as part of the PCF marketplace.</li>
<li>New Virtual Message Router: Solace has released version 7.2 of its Solace Virtual Message Router that offers much higher performance than previous versions, and adds new functionality such as compressed client connections and enhanced security.</li>
<li>VMR Community Edition: A free version of the Solace Virtual Message Router called the Community Edition offers the same messaging/streaming functionality and performance as the company&rsquo;s Enterprise Edition, and is available for immediate download.</li>
<li>DevOps Integration and Automation: Solace now supports and leverages popular DevOps tools including GitHub, Maven Central, Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Spring Cloud.</li>
<li>REST Management API: Version 2 of Solace Element Management Protocol will be released this fall. SEMP v2 is a REST API that enables tools like Chef, Puppet, Ansible and Bosh to automate the configuration and provisioning of Solace message routers.</li>
<li>Solace Labs: A new resource called Solace Labs is home to open source code-based projects that make it easier to implement and extend Solace technology. Projects related to Spring Cloud and Cloud Foundry are available today, and the company is actively seeking contributions from the developer community.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The changes we&rsquo;re announcing today will help enterprises leave behind the days of being locked in to architectural decisions, commercial products or specific cloud environments,&rdquo; said Solace CEO Craig Betts. &ldquo;The level of change CIO&rsquo;s are driving requires pervasive choice now along with flexibility to change your mind later, and we&rsquo;re committed to giving that to them.&rdquo;</p>
