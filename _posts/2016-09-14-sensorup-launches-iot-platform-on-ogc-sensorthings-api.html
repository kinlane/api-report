This historic move provides IoT developers worldwide with the first OGC/ISO standards-based IoT Platform. IoT companies and developers will now be able to accelerate the creation of standards-compliant IoT products and services.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Standards-compliance is critical in IoT, as it makes it possible to exchange data between disparate sensors. This means that, when the need arises, the data being reported by completely different sensing systems can be combined. This has real-world implications ranging from useful -- such as the ability to connect your fitness band to your calorie intake app -- to life supporting -- such as when it enables adjacent municipalities to share near real-time sensor information while collaborating to manage a disaster.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Using a standards-based IoT Platform also helps IoT users avoid vendor lock-in. Companies and developers can now create IoT applications, or connect IoT devices, without worrying that the platform they have connected to will become obsolete, or be âbrickedâ shortly thereafter. Because of this, choosing a platform based on open standards supports longer product life cycles.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Dr. Steve Liang, editor of the OGC SensorThings API standard specification, and globally recognized Internet of Things expert, explained why working with standards is so important:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWhen proprietary, black-box platforms are used, there is a very real possibility that the platform will be discontinued, at which point developers and vendors would have to re-start, often from scratch. This wastes time and resources that most companies would rather spend elsewhere.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The launch occurred at the GeoInt 2016 Symposium in Florida. SensorUp is attending GeoInt to demonstrate both its OGC SensorThings API Platform, and its Disaster Management Incident Management Information Sharing System. More information on the platform is available at http://www.sensorup.com/index.php/iot-platform/.</p>
