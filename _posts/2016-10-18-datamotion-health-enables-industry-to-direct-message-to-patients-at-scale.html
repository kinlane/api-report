<p>&nbsp;DataMotion Health&trade;, a provider of&nbsp;clinical data delivery services and solutions, today announced the DataMotion Direct Provisioning Portal (DPP), a new resource aimed at extending Direct Secure Messaging (Direct) to patients nationwide. The DPP web-based tools are part of the company's plan to enable healthcare organizations and health IT solution providers to integrate and deliver Direct addresses to entire clinician and patient communities efficiently and at scale. Direct is a powerful communications protocol for secure health information exchange, which requires a time-consuming multi-step process to ensure the security and identity of its user base. The new DPP streamlines and automates provisioning to successfully and cost-effectively achieve scale. The DPP includes APIs for programmatic provisioning by applications such as EHRs and mobile health apps. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The way to improve health outcomes is to improve access to clinical information across care teams and patients and their families alike," said<span class="xn-person">David C. Kibbe</span>, M.D., president and CEO of DirectTrust, an independent non-profit trade association created by and for participants in the Direct Secure Messaging community. "There are now more than 1.2 million Direct addresses that allow professionals in more than 58,000 healthcare organizations to securely communicate with each other. It's time that community is extended to include consumers and patients, which is the primary goal of our new Partnership for Patients Project. Millions of Direct addresses are required to bring patients into the fold, and through DataMotion Health's innovation in the provisioning process, along with similar efforts by other members of DirectTrust, it can finally occur at a scale and cost that will make this a reality."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creating Direct accounts involves several steps. These include obtaining necessary digital certificates, registering and activating accounts - a process that is ripe for automation as adoption among providers accelerates and patients are added. The DPP simplifies, automates and expedites this by combining user registration, certification and account management functions, enabling provisioning for organizations of any size and at any volume through a self-service portal that dramatically reduces overhead. The intuitive interface eliminates complexity in provisioning new Direct addresses and in managing provider and patient accounts. It also offers centralized reporting for ONC compliance needs.</p>
<p>For software and app developers, a DataMotion Direct Developers Program includes a Software Developers Kit and pre-production sandbox. This makes it easy to integrate clinical data exchange and be leveraged by mHealth solutions, a market that MarketsandMarkets projects will reach<span class="xn-money">$59.15 billion</span>&nbsp;by 2020. Hackensack University Medical Center, the largest provider of inpatient and outpatient health services in&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">New Jersey</span>, has leveraged the technology to enhance their mobile app for an industry-first solution &ndash; patient self-enrollment with multi-factor identity validation. docsnap, a mobile app offered through primary care providers, has integrated DataMotion Health functions to give patients a centralized copy of their clinical and lab records, as well as the ability to share information with care team members.</p>
<p>"DPP provides easy, cost-effective provisioning of Direct addresses for organizations, providers and patients," said the CTO and Co-founder of DataMotion Health,&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Bob Janacek</span>. "At the same time, the implications in mHealth are enormous, empowering the consumer with easy exchange of their medical records, labs and fitness data with care team members and clinical systems, and even allowing pre- registration when visiting a new doctor. It's not only convenient, it places the patient at the center of care, and by doing so, all involved in treatment can be on the same page to deliver more cost effective treatment and better health outcomes."</p>
