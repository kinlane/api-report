<p><a href="https://zvelo.com">zvelo</a>, the leading provider of website and device categorization, today unveiled zveloAPI&trade;, an ultra-fast, secure API for accessing the zveloDP datasets through cloud-based queries and streaming data feeds.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are very excited to announce the zveloAPI,&rdquo; said Lou Nabarrete, VP of Engineering and Data Operations for zvelo. &ldquo;The expansion of the web continues at a record pace from current domains to new domain extensions to IoT devices that are web accessible. Popular social content, malicious payloads and inappropriate content are now served deeper into each and every website. Understanding what content is being served using the URL address or the domain name itself has become much more complicated. With the introduction of the zveloAPI, our API allows for our partners to interact with any or all of the zveloDP datasets to address this expansion and the associated challenges. Simply put, the zveloAPI gives the power to our partners, so they have greater flexibility to be more successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">zveloAPI was designed to support a broad range of integration and deployment requirements, including:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Cloud-based queries of any of the zveloDP datasets &ndash; ideal for mobile devices with limited storage resources, such as web filtering or parental controls on tablets or mobile phones.</li>
<li>Streaming data feed for any or all zveloDB datasets &ndash; ideal for advanced enterprise, ad tech or subscriber analytics applications where capacity exists to consume terabytes of data generated by zvelo&rsquo;s content and device categorization services and who require ingestion of the datasets into existing databases and systems, thereby eliminating any latency on lookups.</li>
<li>Content Agnostic &ndash; enabled for the submission of both URLs as well as unstructured content such as document text, tweets, SMS, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">The zveloAPI is accessible over Secure RESTful Web Services and Data Streams, allowing customers to leverage existing development expertise in the environment and language of their choice. Also, the API provides complete and seamless compatibility for existing zveloDB and zveloDB SDK deployments.</p>
