<p>Dell Boomi today announced its data and application integration technology is supplying critical interoperability between the Salesforce Sales Cloud CRM instances that were in place at Dell and EMC before the historic merger. By using Dell Boomi&rsquo;s market-leading AtomSphere integration platform as a service (iPaaS) to unify the disparate Salesforce systems, Dell Technologies has achieved vital visibility and collaboration to drive immediate business impact in such areas as cross-sell of complementary Dell and EMC products, revenue forecasting, sales pipeline management and supply chain planning.</p>
<p>When the Dell EMC transaction was announced, sales force readiness and revenue forecasting were identified as critical considerations for a seamless transition on day one and beyond. Bridging the gap between the dual Salesforce systems became a priority to avoid the error-prone inefficiencies of sales reps, account managers and finance professionals manually reconciling and reporting on data from disconnected systems. The Dell Boomi iPaaS platform, connecting any combination of cloud and on-premises applications without the burden of installing and maintaining integration software or appliances, was the ideal choice to integrate the Dell and EMC Salesforce instances.</p>
<p>Collaborating with EMC IT and end-users from both Dell and EMC, Dell&rsquo;s IT team completed development and testing work in only a few weeks, after reconciling disparate business rules and processes at the two companies. Launched into production when the merger finalized, Dell Boomi&rsquo;s real-time, bi-directional integration has enabled visibility and collaboration across the unified Dell Technologies global sales team, comprised of more than 40,000 sales professionals. Sales team members have a single view of more than 50,000 open opportunities across the newly combined company to pursue cross-sell synergies across complementary server, storage, virtualization and PC technologies in the combined portfolio. The sales team can also easily identify competing &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; products to avoid potential opportunity and pipeline conflicts.</p>
<p>At the executive and planning levels, Dell Boomi&rsquo;s integration enables insight and control for revenue forecasting, pipeline management and supply chain planning without the delay and cost of manually exporting data from standalone Salesforce systems. As a result, Dell Technologies has the comprehensive, real-time visibility needed to accurately forecast revenue, better manage the sales team, ensure optimal inventory of components and react quickly to challenges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dell Boomi plays a crucial role in the Dell-EMC combination by providing our unified team of more than 40,000 sales reps with visibility and collaboration from day one,&rdquo; said Chris McNabb, CEO of Dell Boomi. &ldquo;By using Boomi to integrate separate Salesforce Sales Cloud applications at both Dell and EMC, Dell Technologies is poised for rapid time to value and business impact from the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>McNabb said he anticipated that Dell Boomi would play a key role across the newly combined Dell Technologies landscape, offering a broad range of proven and flexible solutions for data and application integration, master data management (MDM) and API management. Dell has utilized its Boomi platform for about a half-dozen previous internal integration projects, including connecting Microsoft Azure Active Directory to a third-party fulfillment system to automate licensing order processes. EMC was a Boomi user itself, relying on Boomi for integration between Salesforce and an Aprimo marketing tool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dell Boomi is immensely valuable for a large enterprise to do any-to-any integrations across either cloud or on-premises systems,&rdquo; McNabb continued. &ldquo;That a small development team could accomplish this initial Salesforce integration in only a few weeks illustrates the time to value and ease of use that has made Dell Boomi a leader in the integration platform as a service market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate Parsons, business owner and IT integration lead for the project, said Dell Boomi was the ideal choice for the Salesforce integration project. &ldquo;Boomi came through in flying colors to get our salesmakers collaborating on day one,&rdquo; said Parsons. &ldquo;Boomi&rsquo;s lightweight footprint and ease of use made development very straightforward work. It&rsquo;s an extremely agile, cost-effective and robust platform that in this case addresses a critical high-priority need.&rdquo;</p>
