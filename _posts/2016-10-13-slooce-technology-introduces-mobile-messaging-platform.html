<p>As more and more enterprises seek to communicate and interact with their customers anywhere and anytime, they increasingly require mobile messaging solutions that are both scalable and cost-effective, and which enable them to reach their users on any mobile device. Slooce Technology's introduction of its universal mobile messaging platform, featuring unlimited enterprise SMS messaging for a flat monthly fee, is a timely answer to meet that growing demand.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Over the past decade, our messaging solutions have evolved to fully support enterprises which increasingly require personal and direct contact with their client base at the rate of thousands or millions of messages per month,&rdquo; stated Behfar Razavi, Slooce Technology Founder and CEO. &ldquo;Our solution makes sense on a technical level because our robust platform can handle heavy traffic and complexity; and it makes sense on a financial level because our flat monthly fee model leaves no room for surprise spending&mdash;it gives enterprises the opportunity to ramp up their messaging without the risk of incurring increased costs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By offering high-performance text messaging short codes provisioned on all U.S. mobile operator networks, Slooce Technology's platform enables enterprises to reach their customers instantly on any mobile device and any wireless network.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Slooce has enabled us to effectively reach our audience of more than 50 million members while they are on the go,&rdquo; says John Krautzel, VP of Marketing and Member Experience at Beyond.com. &ldquo;Slooce&rsquo;s mobile messaging platform allows us to provide job seekers, who want to be the first to know about quality job opportunities, with the information they need to become someone&rsquo;s next great hire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By creating an opportunity for enterprises to obtain unlimited messaging for a flat monthly fee, Slooce's platform enables them to cap their operational and variable costs as their subscriber base grows. The platform also provides substantial cost savings enabling them to focus on revenue growth instead of worrying about messaging costs spiraling out of control. Having text messages as a fixed-cost line item is convenient and continuously saves thousands of dollars for those who switch over from per-message-fee providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Through the use of Slooce Technology's easy-to-integrate messaging API and campaign management tools, customers are able to add innovative text messaging features to their products and services and launch new services in a matter of days.</p>
