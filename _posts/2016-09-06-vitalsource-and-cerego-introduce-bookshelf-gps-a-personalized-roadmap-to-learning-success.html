<p><a href="http://www.vitalsource.com">VitalSource Technologies Inc.,</a> Ingram Content Group&rsquo;s educational technology division, together with Cerego, the standard for personalized learning, announce the launch and immediate availability of Bookshelf GPS&trade;, a customizable learning platform that combines the best of VitalSource&rsquo;s Bookshelf&reg; platform, the most widely used e-textbook platform in the world, with Cerego&rsquo;s personalized learning technology.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Bookshelf GPS gives faculty and instructors the tools to easily create learning content and specific study items based on keywords and concepts they want students to master. The VitalSource platform enables instructors to highlight text within a particular passage, and Cerego&rsquo;s algorithms guide the process of presenting that information to students in different formats to help them learn faster and remember longer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Students take different paths to learning, and Bookshelf GPS serves as a personalized guide to help them learn in the way and at the pace that fits their individual needs,&rdquo; said Pep Carrera, Chief Operating Officer, VitalSource. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve combined technology and access to learning content into one tool that empowers faculty, instructors and students to chart their own course to learning success.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">VitalSource features an inventory of over 1 million titles from more than 1,000 educational publishers around the world. Bookshelf GPS was created so it can be applied to any of VitalSource&rsquo;s titles, seamlessly and at scale.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Instructors have full editorial capabilities to create key items, choose the method by which study items are sourced, the pace at which items are presented to students and the visibility of these study items to students throughout their personalized reading experience. They also have access to analytics through Cerego&rsquo;s memory bank view. This visualization offers real-time information about how students are progressing at any given moment, both individually and as a class, so that instructors can adapt and tailor the learning experience as needed.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Bookshelf GPS offers students and instructors the tools, data and feedback they need to be successful. It is no longer sufficient to rely on a prescriptive, &lsquo;one size fits all&rsquo; model for learning, and this gives instructors the freedom to teach and adapt the textbook as they see fit,&rdquo; said Andrew Smith Lewis, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman, Cerego. &ldquo;Our hope is that by providing an affordable and accessible solution that rethinks the status quo, we will drive significant outcomes for students and instructors alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Students can access digital content on any device or operating system to progress their studies on the go, anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Bookshelf GPS meaningfully advances the evolution of digital course content being used on our campus,&rdquo; said Jason Lorgan, Executive Director, UC Davis Stores. &ldquo;The product leverages all the best features of the VitalSource platform into a more interactive and engaging format, where each student can have a different experience based on where they are in their mastery of the content. The accessibility of the VitalSource platform makes Bookshelf GPS a particularly compelling addition to our digital delivery program. We are very excited to bring this product to our faculty and students this fall term.&rdquo;</p>
