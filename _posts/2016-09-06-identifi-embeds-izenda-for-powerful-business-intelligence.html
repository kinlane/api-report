<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_61174_identifi_dashboards_b1.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.identifi.net">Identifi</a> today announced that the company chose <a href="http://www.Izenda.com">Izenda</a> as its embedded business intelligence and analytics solution for its business process management collaboration software.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Identifi leads the way with products that incorporate the best of enterprise content management (ECM), business process management (BPM), and electronic signatures to build a new breed of collaboration software.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Izenda fills the need for a self-service BI solution that puts visibility into the operations of the entire enterprise.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWhen you marry a business process management solution with Izenda, now you are obviously getting up to date immediate visibility and measurement of your operations,â said Tim Jagodzinski, Identifiâs VP of Business Development.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Identifi enables customers to automate their business processes. The addition of a real-time BI tool enables them to improve their training and the process over time.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âItâs the difference between a gut feeling of where things are working and not working versus really knowing,â Jagodzinski said.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Identifi will move from supplying only system level reports into enabling creation of high-value operational reports in the product. Izendaâs functionality enables end users to create customized day-to-day operational reports with immediate value. These reports reveal actual operational performance, which can truly improve customer satisfaction on their end, creating visibility into how effectively they are serving their customer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Identifi chose Izendaâs embedded BI solution for its rich features and functions. The ease of creation of reports, dashboards and visualizations, and its flexibility are strong points. Identifi now offers customers much more visibility into their process than what Identifi could offer in the past with Crystal Reports.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âIt took a technically trained person to do it, where Izenda is much easier to work with and doesnât require the same level of technical expertise to get started,â Jagodzinski said.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">One of Identifiâs bottlenecks was having to produce reports for customers with Crystal Reports. Almost none of their customers were able to create their own reports.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe want our customers to be empowered to create their reports and Crystal Reports does not lend itself to that,â Jagodzinski said.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Izendaâs self-service BI solution will enable Identifi to build standard reports much easier and faster than they can do today. And it will make it possible for customers to take over their own report and dashboard creation. The platformâs data visualizations enable business users to discover trends and insights. That will put information and insights into customersâ hands much more quickly, leading to customer satisfaction. And it will free the Identifi development teamâs time so additional product innovations can be implemented.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âIzenda was our first choice solution for their ability to serve the ISV market. With Izenda, we have the flexibility to integrate their product both on premises and in the cloud. Izendaâs support for multiple API stacks and developer resources made the integration simple,â said Aaron Stine, Identifiâs SVP of Development.</p>
