<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/apievangelistsitenewsgi-62598-lingklogovcolorhirespng" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://noblestream.com">NobleStream</a>, which helps academic institutions across the country evaluate, implement, and reap the advantages of EdTech solutions and systems that drive both student success and organizational growth, proudly announced today that it has welcomed Lingk to its portfolio of best-in-class solution providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For many years, the lack of open APIs and open data models in the academic sector has blocked innovation for learner pathways, restricted valuable analytic insights, and dramatically slowed the adoption of new technologies. Lingkâs open API platform and student lifecycle data integration services overcome these obstacles by enabling academic organizations to rapidly implement and securely connect hundreds of disparate applications across education domains.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThrough this dynamic new partnership, we are now well-positioned to help our clients nationwide reap the rewards of Lingkâs groundbreaking solution so they can liberate their ecosystems to innovate in the new API economy, leverage the power of data to tell their unique story, and bring about transformative change to meet the needs of students,â commented Howard Weiner, NobleStreamâs Managing Partner.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"NobleStream works closely with leaders and faculty, and has a deep understanding of the technological challenges and opportunities that today's academic organizations face,â commented Paul Roberge, President of Lingk. âWe believe that this partnership with Howard and his team further supports our mission of bringing the API economy to education."</p>
