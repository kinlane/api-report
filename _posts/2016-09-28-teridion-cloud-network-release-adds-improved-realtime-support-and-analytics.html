<p><a href="http://www.teridion.com">Teridion</a>, the cloud-based networking company that delivers the fastest Internet experience, announces today its latest Global Cloud Network (GCN) release, adding powerful analytics, better real-time application handling, provisioning and security capabilities. These new features continue to differentiate the Teridion offering from traditional Content Delivery Networks or SD-WAN. All current customers have been transparently upgraded to this release without any downtime or service degradation. To hear about the new release and worldwide customer deployments, visit Teridion at the Velocity Conference, June 22-23, at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Booth 1216.</p>
<p>The new release includes powerful analytics, including comparative analysis over different timeframes based on a customer&rsquo;s regions and applications. Customers now have a personalized real-time view that they may also export for further analysis, and the combination of both visibility and control via the Teridion GCN is unique. Release 1.3 also includes improved support for real-time and API-driven applications, in addition to capabilities used by current enterprise file and backup services. Customers using Teridion for VoIP, conferencing services and real-time API now have better support, visibility and configuration abilities, as well as performance verification via ThousandEyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teridion has done pretty well by identifying a challenge in the cloud service provider space and solving that problem for its customers,&rdquo; said Zeus Kerravala, principal analyst at ZK Research. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy trying to solve Internet performance problems for the world&rsquo;s largest providers, because they have the trust of their users in their hands and Teridion is playing an important role here. Glad to see the product advancing and adding capabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other new capabilities include automated in-service additions of new CSPs via the Teridion Management System (TMS) API, allowing the company to quickly address specific in-region requirements. Teridion&rsquo;s GCN now encompasses more than one hundred major data centers spanning over 15 major cloud service providers, with recently announced examples including Vultr and Russian provider Selectel. Enhancements to the API also include third-party provisioning. For example, a Teridion CSP partner may offer the service as part of its standard offerings.</p>
