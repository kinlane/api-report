<p><img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/scale_to_grow_your_business.png" alt="" width="40%" align="right" /><a href="https://www.continuum.net/">Continuum<sup>&reg;</sup></a>, the only channel-exclusive IT management platform company, and BrightGauge, a leading provider of business intelligence software for IT services providers, announced they are now integrated, allowing the consolidation of IT vendor reports in one place. The integration also allows MSPs to build custom dashboards and reports which help drive technicians&rsquo; efficiency and ultimately more profits to the bottom line. MSPs now can create custom reports and dashboards that integrate reporting from other tools as well such as Intuit QuickBooks<sup>&reg;</sup>, Dropbox and all the major PSA tools. The integration leverages the new Continuum Reporting API now available which allows vendors to obtain raw reporting data from Continuum to build custom reports in-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very excited about our new integration partnership with Continuum,&rdquo; said Eric Dosal, Co-Founder and CEO of BrightGauge. &ldquo;This has been a long time coming as many of our customers have been moving to Continuum and requesting to have their data centralized in BrightGauge.&nbsp;The Continuum team has been awesome to work with as well as a huge driver in making this integration happen in a short time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MSPs will take less time to create custom client reports and online dashboards for customers to access that include appealing visuals, showcasing the value MSPs deliver to clients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today, there is a great deal of information on our partners&rsquo; systems that they need to report out,&rdquo; said Adrianna Gugel, Product Manager at Continuum. &ldquo;We are happy to meet their needs with this integration, providing an easy-to-use interface for consolidating IT vendor information, streamlining reporting for technicians. We were pleased to work with BrightGauge through the integration development process, as well as in the development of Continuum&rsquo;s new Reporting API.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our organization has come to rely on our BrightGauge dashboard and daily reports to help keep things top of mind, and this integration is crucial to our daily operations,&rdquo; said Bryan Badger, CEO at Integral Networks, Inc. &ldquo;In the short time we have been using the integration, we have been able to more clearly see our problem areas and take action. No more relying on someone to go into Continuum&rsquo;s platform to generate a separate report, we can now access Continuum data within our BrightGauge dashboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To get started, MSPs should go to the doc center to learn more and get a Continuum Reporting API key.</p>
