<p><a href="http://www.kinvey.com">Kinvey</a>, the leading enterprise mobile Backend as a Service (mBaaS) and Venado Technologies today announced a partnership to deliver Xamarin-based cross-platform digital solutions for the enterprise market, starting with field service automation.  Venado, a mobile strategy consulting services provider, has become a certified Kinvey reseller, selecting Kinvey&rsquo;s mBaaS platform for delivering and supporting mobile apps for its customers.  Today, Kinvey also launched its Xamarin 3.0 SDK Early Adopter Program.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Digital transformation is occurring in most every industry, field workforce mobilization is no exception.  Less than 30 percent of the U.S. workforce sits at a desk. More than just accessing the right data at the right time, mobile features allow field workers to optimize their schedule, receive on-site instructions, capture data, take pictures, use dictation and complete transactions while on the road in realtime.  Contextualizing the user experience increases both field service and back office operational efficiency while improving overall customer service. Securely mobilizing corporate data for field workers is no longer an option &ndash; it&rsquo;s a requirement to compete.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;In industries like logistics, facilities management, manufacturing, pharma, food service and others, companies need to provide their field service teams with the technology to improve customer service and satisfaction, thereby gaining competitive advantage,&rdquo; said Justin Lake, principal at Venado. &ldquo;Using Kinvey as our mobile platform and Xamarin app dev lifecycle tools, we can focus on the unique needs of our customers to deliver superior apps with fewer resources, in less time and at a lower cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Providing a five-star user experience is hard for a field workforce who often have poor connectivity, need full app functionality when offline, need to handle synchronization of large data sets when back online, and often need to connect to legacy systems that measure performance in seconds instead of mobile-friendly milliseconds,&rdquo; said Sravish Sridhar, CEO and founder of Kinvey. &ldquo;With our platform, including our Xamarin SDK, we&rsquo;ve focused on addressing these hard technology problems so Venado and other partners can put their energies towards app innovation, not mobile infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Kinvey&rsquo;s mBaaS provides development organizations like Venado a turn-key, reusable cloud-based platform on which to deliver client applications quickly and reliably, reducing risk of project time and cost overruns. The scalable mBaaS provides all the functionality and performance required to deliver five-star enterprise apps:</p>

<li> Sub-second data delivery </li>
<li> No-code enterprise data and authentication integrations </li>
<li> Offline operation with flexible data sync options</li>
