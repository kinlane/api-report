<p>API interoperability, automation, and reciprocity provider <a href="https://temboo.com/javascript">Temboo</a> has <a href="https://temboo.com/javascript">released their official JavaScript SDK</a>, which allows you to build orchestrations around the 100+ APIs that are available on the platform, using purely client side JavaScript.</p>
<p>Temboo provides four simple examples to demonstrate what is possible:</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
<li>Display the current temperature</li>
<li>Send an email via Gmail</li>
<li>Upload a text file to Dropbox</li>
<li>Save form data to a Google Spreadsheet</li>
</ul>
<p>The Temboo JavaScript SDK makes it possible for developers to build widgets, and other custom scripts that even non-developers can reverse engineer and put to use for themselves, as other languages like PHP, Python and Ruby require server side environments, which might be out of reach for some users.</p>
<p>The release from Temboo, continues the trend around web APIs making data, content, and other programmatic cloud resources available to anyone.</p>
