<p><a href="http://home.mparticle.com/">mParticle</a>, the only customer data platform built for mobile, today announced it has launched several new platform upgrades. These include changes to its SDKs and a new API for partners to build integrations on top of mParticle. The latest release includes the following improvements:&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> mParticle has completely open sourced all of its SDKs across Android, iOS, and JavaScript, providing developers with transparency as well as greater performance, ease of use and flexibility. The latest versions were built on a loosely coupled architecture model with asynchronous APIs, in order to balance speed and reliability. The latest versions of the SDKs are available on Github.</li>
<li> The latest version of the SDK also offers an embedded kit framework to further reduce the weight of the SDK and improve control offered to developers. The update give Apps complete control over which partner libraries they want to include in the core mParticle SDK reducing overhead and improving performance. While most of mParticle&rsquo;s integrations are server-side, some app services like mobile measurement partners and deep linking solutions require client-side integrations. </li>
<li> The latest JavaScript SDK provides Omni-channel marketers with best&ndash;in-class capabilities to collect, connect and convert web data across any partner on any channel. Customers can easily remove data silos across web and app, and easily unify identities across all their properties. The latest JavaScript SDK also fully addresses complex ecommerce web data, allowing any ecommerce brand to easily handle product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout data.</li>
<li> The Firehose API is a self-service API that allows anyone who has built an analytics or marketing service and offer access to their service to any of the apps on the platform. The API allows App Services to fast track the integration process in order to improve speed to market, making their services available to anyone who uses mParticle. The API is built on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda.</li>
</ul>
