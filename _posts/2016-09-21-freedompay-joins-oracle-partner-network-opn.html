FreedomPayâs Commerce Platform will deliver a full suite of payment solutions through integrations to Oracle MICROS Food and Beverage POS, Xstore, OPERA PMS, and MICROS Web solutions.Â </p>
<p>The FreedomPay Commerce Platform will provide Oracle customers a turn-key solution for deploying PCI-validated P2PE credit card payment devices with EMV and NFC capabilities delivering greater transaction security and PCI scope reduction throughout their locations. FreedomPayâs industry leading payment security, with full integration into OPERA PMS and recently launched MICROS Pay-At-Table solution, is designed to meet the needs of Oracle Hospitalityâs clients. A rapidly expanding list of global leaders in entertainment and hospitality have chosen the FreedomPay Commerce Platform to protect their guestsâ credit card data with PCI-validated P2PE and EMV capabilities.</p>
<p>FreedomPayâs Commerce Platform satisfies many of the complicated payment scenarios Oracle customers face every day. The FreedomPay PCI-validated solution is delivered through Ingenico Groupâs broad array of payment devices and is offered as an integrated toolkit with MICROS 3700, 9700, Symphony 1.x and Symphony 2.x, OPERA and Xstore, providing all the benefits of PCI-validated P2PE, EMV, NFC, Pay-At-Table support, digital signature capture, advertising management, offline support, dynamic currency conversion, card blacklisting, tokenization and secure integration with online travel agents (OTAs). By deploying a PCI-validated solution, point-of-sale systems and networks are removed from annual PCI DSS compliance scope, saving customers the cost of lengthy documentation, penetration testing and vulnerability scans of the point of sale environment as part of that process.</p>
