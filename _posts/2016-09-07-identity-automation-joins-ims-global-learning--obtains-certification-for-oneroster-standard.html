<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/identity_automation__identity_management_streamlined.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.identityautomation.com">Identity Automation</a>, provider of the most scalable full-lifecycle identity and access management (IAM) solution on the market, today announced it has become an Affiliate member of the IMS Global Learning Consortium.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Identity Automation is the first organization to obtain conformance certification as a OneRoster provider and consumer, using either the CSV or the REST API exchange methods of the standard, enabling the seamless, bi-directional synchronization of roster data between disparate education systems. Not only does Identity Automation provide student roster, teacher, student, and assessment data to other OneRoster certified vendors, it also has the flexibility to consume and transfer data from any system, allowing schools to focus scarce resources on identifying the right curriculum, rather than spending time and effort trying to make it work.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âSchools are becoming increasingly digital, incorporating new learning systems, such as digital textbooks and cloud-based learning management systems, that require roster data,â said Troy Moreland, CTO of Identity Automation. âAdvanced bi-directional data workflows are complex and must be handled with precision, but this is often a challenge for curriculum professionals who donât necessarily have a technology background. OneRoster standards make it easier, more cost-effective, and less-time consuming for schools to integrate their data and make the digital classroom a reality.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">RapidIdentityâ¢ is Identity Automationâs Identity and Access Management platform, specifically designed to intelligently automate user provisioning, access, and account management for organizations of any size. These attributes, along with Identity Automationâs ability to provide continuous integration between student information systems and education services and applications, provide a powerful, cost-efficient, and easy-to-use solution for IT and curriculum professionals who want to simply, securely, and automatically manage roster data. With over ten years of experience, hundreds of installations, and over 10 million RapidIdentity users, Identity Automation leads the education sector in enabling and securing todayâs digital edtech ecosystems.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Before RapidIdentity, we spent months extracting data from our student information system, Skyward and loading it into five different textbook systems at the beginning of each semester,â says Grapevine-Colleyville Independent School District's curriculum technology project lead. âNow, the first time our students log into the RapidIdentity Portal, they automatically have single sign-on access to their online applications, textbooks, and course materials, providing them with a secure, hassle-free experience. With RapidIdentity, our roster data is always up-to-date in our textbook vendor systems.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The mission of the IMS Global Learning Consortium is to advance technology that can affordably scale and improve educational participation and attainment. The OneRoster standard is a subset of the Learning Information Services standard that focuses on the schoolâs needs to exchange roster information and grades. The standard includes both SOAP and REST-based bindings to make it quicker and easier to implement the exchange of information about people, membership, courses, and outcomes. In addition to the standard, OneRoster includes a format for CSV files that are typically exchanged between the school and the vendor to populate the roster information needed to gain access to learning tools, portals, and learning environments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe applaud Identity Automation for their expansive strategy, being the first organization to obtain conformance certification as a OneRoster provider and consumer, using either the CSV or the REST API exchange methods of the standardâ, said Mark Leuba, Vice President of Product Management for IMS Global. âUsing a product like Identity Automation, which supports a full range of certified-compliant options, provides districts with flexibility to start with a basic daily exchange of roster information and move to a more sophisticated real-time exchange of roster information to really fit the needs of the educators and the students.â</p>
