<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_115102_movableink_logo_transparent.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.movableink.com">Movable Ink</a>, the global leader in contextual email technology, today added a new set of applications to its Live Content product. With Movable Inkâs technology, email marketers can already deliver personalized content that changes, in real time, based on CRM data such as loyalty status; and real-time contextual data including location, device, or local weather.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Now, Movable Inkâs Behavioral Apps unlock real-time access to data that most email marketers are unable to leverage in campaigns, enabling them to send more deeply personalized emails based on the on-site behavior of each individual customer. Marketers can use the Behavioral Apps in either triggered emails or mass mailings sent via their existing ESP.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âToday, when consumers have endless choices, the chance to grab their attention and spur them to act hinges on how personally relevant the marketing message is,â said Vivek Sharma, CEO of Movable Ink. âWe see great continued opportunity to marry real-time signals and content in ways that donât interrupt the customer experience, but enhance it by offering what they want at the right time and place. This was the vision behind these new applications and every product we build.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Marketers can use the Behavioral Apps to create content in emails based upon a wide variety of customer actions. Products and content tailored to an individual can be rendered in real-time based upon a customerâs recent behavior and can be suppressed if that customer hasnât recently visited a brandâs website or has completed a purchase. Content is targeted to individuals based on:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Recently Viewed Products</li>
<li>Most Viewed Products</li>
<li>Abandoned Cart Contents</li>
<li>Last Product Category Browsed</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">Movable Ink clients can use the new Behavioral Apps the same way they already pull live content elements into their emails from any website, social stream, RSS feed, or API call. The Behavioral Apps cross-device tracking aggregates customer data and updates content based on how a customer interacts with a brand across multiple devices; and all of this is powered by an easy, one-time setup that doesnât require IT resources for each new campaign.</p>
