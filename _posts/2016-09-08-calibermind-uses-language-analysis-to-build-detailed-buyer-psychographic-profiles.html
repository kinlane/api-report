The company is the first to apply machine learning and human language analysis to build psychographic B2B buyer profiles based on data from many sources. Marketers and sales pros now have valuable insight into the behavior and preferences of their individual prospects they have never had before. CaliberMind is built for midsize and enterprise B2B companies focused on building high-value relationships with their accounts to accelerate sales. An impressive roster of early beta customers includes Citrix, Convercent and ReturnPath. Today the companyâs beta product is publicly available.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The massive shift toward account based marketing and selling requires a deeper level of understanding into what makes prospects tick, and this isnât found in traditional demographic data such as job title, industry and company size. âCaliberMind helps us communicate more effectively in a way that resonates with our 330,000 customers,â says Justin Zacks, Director of Customer Insights at Citrix. Today, beta customers see 40% lift in conversion on average when they move to more tailored, persona-based marketing communications based on a prospect's behaviors, motivations and other psychographic data. Sales reps can fine-tune their sales calls, emails and demos based on who they are talking to, and sales cycles have been shortened by 30%.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWeâre doing something that wasnât possible a year ago,â says Raviv Turner, Co-Founder and CEO of CaliberMind. âFirst, the science of building robust psychographic profiles on people based on text analysis is new. And recent advances in deep machine learning now make it possible for CaliberMind to identify abstract psychological traits by analyzing disparate, structured and unstructured data pulled from virtually any source.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">CaliberMindâs proprietary technology combines natural (human) language processing with deep machine learning technology â much like IBMs Watson and Googleâs newly-released Natural Language API â to analyze data about a companyâs prospective and current customers. CRM data, voice and email conversations between sales reps and customers are automatically scanned and blended with data captured by marketing automation tools to predict the type of content a prospect prefers. CaliberMind also scours the entire web gathering external data about target prospects, including their social footprint.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">CaliberMind synthesizes all of this data to reveal predominant persona archetypes based on more than 30 facets such as a prospectâs pain points, content preferences, decision making style, and personality traits. For marketers and sales reps, these CaliberMind personas serve as a personalized playbook for each customer. For example, the playbook will recommend that a prospect who is an analytical, revenue-minded CMO be sent the white paper featuring an ROI calculator.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Marketing automation tools let B2B marketers operate at scale, but itâs still comes down to sending the right the message. Carlos Hidalgo is a veteran marketer who leads a demand-gen strategy firm with hundreds of enterprise B2B clients. âCaliberMind is the first product Iâve seen that brings psychographic, behavioral and demographic data together. This holistic view of their buyers will help marketers dial-in their content to improve return on their demand-gen investment,â says Hidalgo, CEO & Principal of Annuitas.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Early investors in CaliberMind include Boomtown Accelerator, Justin Darcy, Strategic ISV & OEM Alliances at Salesforce, and Don Hazell, former VP of Worldwide Sales at Rally Software. Today the company is generating revenue from its paid beta customers and plans to close its seed investment round later this summer.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Nic Zangre, who most recently led Marketing Operations at AdRoll in the Bay area, has joined as VP of Marketing and Sales Technology. âOur goal is to enable customers to leverage deep machine learning to understand their customer data. We can securely read and interpret data from customer data silos across and outside the organization, including Salesforce, Marketo, Zendesk, Intercom, Amazon Redshift, and Twitter. There are countless applications for NLP and persona modeling in account-based marketing and sales â we hope to be an essential addition to tomorrowâs B2B toolkit,â says Zangre.
