<p class="responsiveNews">When one of Blackbayâs major e-commerce customers had a vision for a new type of delivery solution, which would allow them to improve not only the accuracy of delivery, but also provide personalised delivery capability to an individualâs current location as opposed to address, Blackbay turned to what3words to help pinpoint the location of the recipient down to a 3m x 3m square.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">what3words is a global location reference system that has divided the world into 57 trillion 3metre x 3metre squares and pre-assigned each of them a unique 3 word address. It means everywhere on the planet, no matter how remote or precise, now has a simple address that can be easily communicated and navigated to.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWeâve gone from waiting by the post-box for weeks, to getting pizzas on moving trains. Delivery companies are no longer delivering to an address, but to an individual. Delivery has become vastly more personal and more responsive, but consumer expectations continue to rise. With online shopping now second nature, weâre moving to an on-demand economy where a delivery could be required whilst shopping, or whilst visiting the park. With W3W, Blackbay is able to provide far greater delivery accuracy inside of post codes and to an individual on the beach, at a concert in the park but in all cases: to the individual.â, commented Nigel Doust, CEO Blackbay.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">what3words is integrated into Blackbayâs Delivery Connect. The solution gives instant visibility of all in-depot and driver activity to the logistics operator. It includes capabilities for track-and-trace, dispatching, on-the-road processes, routing and scheduling, to enable operations, drivers and other mobile workers to optimise the delivery and pick-up process. Information captured throughout this process is then made available to consumers in real-time, enabling them to monitor progress, manage their preferences, update the carrier and ensure successful delivery.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âUsing Blackbay, a merchant can offer rapid-fire delivery of an item direct to a buyerâs location â even pinpointing the individualâs location at the beach or park. With what3words we can pinpoint that personâs exact location and navigate to it using any additional delivery instructions the buyer might share based on their surroundings or movementsâ, added Doust.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">However, the need for precise addressing in logistics goes far beyond new delivery models, âPoor addressing costs delivery companies millions a year in last mile and address validation inefficiencies. In the UK 0.5% of deliveries fail due to poor addressing â which means 4.5M attempts per year fail. Street addressing is often inadequate and whilst coordinates are accurate they are prone to errors in transcription and communication. We knew that our ability to help improve this accuracy would be an ideal fit for Blackbayâs innovation brief, but also for improving first-time delivery rates across the industryâ said Chris Sheldrick, CEO, what3words.</p>
