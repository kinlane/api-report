<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/landing_emails.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://www.sendwithus.com/">Sendwithus</a>, a top marketing automation, content management, and development tool for email, has announced Sendwithus Connect, an integration with Amazon Redshift: the go-to data warehouse solution for fast-moving, scalable businesses. With this integration, Sendwithus users will be able to query their own databases to build segments and personalize content directly from the app.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The current options for emailing a specific segment of users can be inaccurate, insecure, and inconvenient. Long data exports from a data warehouse followed by longer imports into an email marketing platform or scheduled synchronization of a data warehouse with a marketing platform, the two major "solutions" each come with their own unique set of problems.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Creating CSVs all the time is a huge time sink not just because of the actual task, but also because it involves additional collaboration between data and marketing teams, which is more organizational overhead. On the other hand, duplicating an entire user base on remote servers can create security and legal concerns, and lead to emails going out with stale data if it goes out at the wrong time.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Sendwithus Connect provides a third option: pull the data from the database when needed. With a direct connection to an Amazon Redshift database, users can build and save queries to create lists on the fly and merge in all the relevant data before it has become inaccurate.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This new feature accomplishes the parallel goals of increasing data accuracyâby decreasing the turnaround time of new email marketing campaignsâand improving marketing workflows for both marketing and data teams. With fewer exports and administrative tasks to run, these teams can collaborate more meaningfully on improving the effectiveness of not just marketing emails but also transactional emails, product updates, and newsletters.</p>
