<p class="responsiveNews">While bundling various tiers into container images, Cloud CMS realized that it had already gone a long way toward defining a proper set of microservices. Docker formalized this reality by providing a way to package service code as well as automate the necessary testing and deployment.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This now makes it incredibly easy for Cloud CMS to manage and deliver the same Software as a Service offering on AWS while also saving in overall costs. Equally important, it opens up a world of possibilities for our customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Michael Uzquiano, CTO at Cloud CMS commented: âWith Docker, we suddenly found ourselves in a position where our customers could not only run Cloud CMS in a hosted capacity, but they could also run Cloud CMS on their own. They could run it on-premise, in their own data centers, and even on their own laptops.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Docker makes it possible for customers of Cloud CMS to deploy a platform instance directly into their applications. Not as a remote API service, but as an integrated, low latency, same subnet and optionally in-process module. Their application may pull in many microservices this way, each deployed as a container.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âAchieving this level of operational flexibility with a single CMS offering is a significant milestone for us - one that we expect to remain unparalleled for some timeâ says Scott Davis, VP of Customer Solutions at Cloud CMS.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Paul Levy, CEO of unbundlED agrees: "Cloud CMS delivers us the most open CMS architecture in the marketplace. It infuses our clients' vertical content with API powers that give every paragraph and every line the highest level of granular control, security and distribution."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">As similar microservices architectures continue to be launched, more and more customers of Cloud CMS consider it key in providing their own unique digital experience.
