</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">The ScripTouch Slimline LCD ST1570 includes the ProScript interface, an application programming interface that allows developers to create rich and powerful applications that integrate the ScripTouch family of products. Using Two-Way Communication, this interface allows your application to instantly receive events from ProScript devices, providing you with the ability to display signatures and events in real time.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The ProScript API also allows you to control the content displayed on the device and gives users the ability to rearrange buttons, push graphics, and modify the display of the device to customize how the device functions for your workflow. Scriptel&rsquo;s ProScript libraries include C++, Java, and .NET and support Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The ScripTouch Slimline LCD ST1571 includes the EasyScript interface. EasyScript was built to enable a simple and convenient way to capture electronic signatures and magnetic card swipe data from a variety of web-based and traditional applications. The EasyScript interface communicates with the computer as if it were a keyboard, providing a simple and portable integration while eliminating the need for plugins, software or drivers like Java applets or ActiveX controls to be installed to run your application, as nearly all devices support USB keyboards.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The original EasyScript was developed to enable IT administrators and software developers to support USB electronic signature pad hardware in browser-based applications without needing additional drivers and installed &ldquo;applets&rdquo; that create potential security issues and trigger frequent updates.</p>
