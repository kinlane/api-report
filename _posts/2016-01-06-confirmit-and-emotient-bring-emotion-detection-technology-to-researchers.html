<p><a href="http://www.confirmit.com">Confirmit</a> has partnered with Emotient, the leader in emotion detection and sentiment analysis technology based on facial expressions, to deliver greater insight to Market Research (MR) organizations and Voice of the Customer (VoC) programs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The partnership answers the need for research organizations to use more sophisticated, detailed and personal behavioral analytics to extract more accurate insight from research surveys. Facial expression recognition technology is an ideal solution, delivering a level of insight about personal sentiment and reaction that cannot be gained through other research methods.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Ken Denman, CEO, Emotient, explained, &ldquo;Attention, engagement and emotion are the currency of revenue growth and customer satisfaction because, put simply, emotions drive spending and loyalty. For organizations running research programs and customer experience surveys, emotion detection technology allows them to analyse an individual&rsquo;s emotional reactions at the point of experience &ndash; delivering greater understanding of behavior patterns and likely future action.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Terry Lawlor, EVP Product Management at Confirmit said, &ldquo;By adding emotion detection to our suite of research solutions, we&rsquo;re empowering our clients to delve even deeper into the behaviors of research respondents and customers. They will be able to make better business decisions, improve product and service offerings, and improve customer experience &ndash; all based on detailed emotional reactions and likely behaviors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Emotient has embedded its technology into Confirmit&rsquo;s survey software, making it easy to add emotion detection to any new or existing MR, VoC or Voice of the Employee program. Respondents are seamlessly transferred during a Confirmit Horizons survey to the Emotient system for the emotion detection to be performed, and then seamlessly returned back to the survey to complete data collection.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Lawlor said, &ldquo;As technology developments move forward at such a rapid pace, it&rsquo;s imperative that we continuously deliver the best solutions to our global client base. Emotient leads the field in emotion-aware computing and was a natural fit for our comprehensive, feature-rich solution set.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Denman concluded, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re delighted to work with Confirmit to expand the reach of our technologies to leading research and corporate organizations and to provide them with the ability to enhance their analytical capabilities to a personal level while remaining fully scalable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The integrated solution is immediately available. Confirmit and Emotient will share more details and demonstrate the integrated solution during an upcoming webinar scheduled for early 2016.</p>
