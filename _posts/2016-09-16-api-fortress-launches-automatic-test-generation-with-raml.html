RAML (RESTful API Modeling Language) is a project led by a group of contributors including Airware, Akana Software, AngularJS, API Science, Cisco, Intuit, MuleSoft, and VMware. API Fortress allows users to build an API test without writing any code, and incorporating the ability to automatically generate a test from a RAML creates an additional method of doing so.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">API Fortress is currently offering free accounts to try the first visually guided API testing platform. It is the only tool that offers the ability to test an entire API without needing to write any code. For the first time a QA, Product Manager, or Project Manager can easily do what was once only possible by developers. All tests are logged, all errors are immediately reported, and all data is available on the dashboard for deeper analysis.</p>
