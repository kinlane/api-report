<p class="responsiveNews">The Compliance Map offers its regulatory management solution to automate obligations companies face from Global RoHS, REACH, Prop65, Conflict Minerals and Supply Chain Transparency, while SiliconExpert provides the most comprehensive electronic component database, including environmental compliance and lifecycle information.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Compliance Mapâs fully automated API downloads environmental compliance data from SiliconExpert based on the parts a company sources and then leverages ERP/PLM integrations (such as with SAP, Agile, Oracle) to pull BOM, part and supplier data to facilitate the automatic roll-up of compliance from chemical level all the way to product level. Compliance risk assessments, gap analysis and full customer and regulatory reporting is automated.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A complete statement is generated where parts and products are identified as compliant, reportable, non-compliant, etc. This provides users with a holistic and fully automated solution for environmental and supply chain compliance.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SiliconExpert's electronic component database is the most comprehensive and current in the industry, providing relevant data and insight needed to remove risk from the supply chain. With solutions to manage risk, avoid redesigns, and mitigate obsolescence, their products reduce the time you spend finding, cross referencing, and data-cleansing electronic components.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A number of joint clients have already benefitted from this partnership, with access to a highly flexible, scalable and comprehensive solution that provides compliance software users with additional data feeds to deal with RoHS, REACH and Conflict Minerals declarations, among others. The global partnership enables the companies to deliver an environmental compliance management system and database, which is particularly useful where electronics and medical device companies require more than a software reporting solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Anthony Delengaigne, Director, Implementation Services, The Compliance Map, commented: âThis partnership provides companies with a fully automated solution for compliance management and data services. Our joint clients now have access to a single platform that delivers the best in class environmental and supply chain management platform and leading component part database on the market.â</p>
