<p><a href="https://www.mparticle.com/">mParticle</a>, the only mobile-first customer data platform, today announced its support for the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project, an open source initiative that makes it easy for publishers to create mobile-friendly content once and have it load instantly everywhere.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Originally championed by Google, Twitter and others, AMP is an open source initiative that takes advantage of various technical approaches to provide a faster experience for mobile users. One of the ways that &ldquo;AMP HTML&rdquo; pages are made faster is that they strip out extraneous elements, including unnecessary third-party tracking tags. With this latest integration, mParticle joins a limited number of selectively-curated technology partners certified to collect data on AMP-enabled content.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;At mParticle, we&rsquo;re fully aligned with AMP&rsquo;s goal of helping publishers improve mobile experiences for both their audience as well as their advertisers,&rdquo; said Michael Katz, Co-Founder and CEO of mParticle. &ldquo;Speed is critical to mobile success, and we&rsquo;re excited that our platform can help publishers deliver on this objective.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Once added to a customer&rsquo;s pages with a simple line of code, mParticle is able to send data safely and securely to more than 100 different analytics, email and mobile marketing platforms.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AMP is mParticle&rsquo;s sixth integration with the Google ecosystem. mParticle is also integrated with Google Analytics, Google Cloud Messaging, Google Big Query, the DoubleClick Data Platform and DoubleClick Campaign Manager.</p>
