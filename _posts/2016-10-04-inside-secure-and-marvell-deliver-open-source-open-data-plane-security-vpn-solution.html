<p><a href="http://www.insidesecure.com">INSIDE Secure (Paris:INSD)</a>, at the heart of security solutions for mobile and connected devices and network equipment, today announced the Marvell-INSIDE Secure solution, a collaboration that provides open source Open Data Plane (ODP) security API support on Marvell&rsquo;s ARMADA&reg; 8K and ARMADA 7K System-on-Chip (SoC) families with embedded INSIDE Secure Security Protocol Accelerator IP technology. The Marvell-INSIDE Secure solution provides customers with an easy and efficient way to secure their high-speed networking applications with access to all of the ARM ecosystem&rsquo;s software support.</p>
<p>Cloud computing, data centers and server farms are expected to process 8.6 ZB of traffic by the end of 2019 according to the Cisco Global Cloud Index, up from 3.4 ZB in 2014, and require significantly more bandwidth every few months. Traditional CPU-based technology consumes too much power and simply cannot handle the workload required to secure increasing traffic. Combined with Marvell&rsquo;s advanced networking technology and ODP API support, the acceleration features of INSIDE Secure&rsquo;s packet engine technology provides an ultra-efficient and high performance VPN solution. The Marvell-INSIDE Secure solution takes a complete IP packet and autonomously transforms it into an encrypted IP packet, or vice versa, offering customers cutting-edge automated intelligence embedded in the solution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to collaborate with INSIDE Secure to offer a high-performance open source VPN solution for our ARMADA 7K and ARMADA 8K SoC family based on multi-core ARM&reg;v8 Cortex&reg; A72 CPUs,&rdquo; said Michael Zimmerman, Vice President and General Manager of Connectivity, Storage and Infrastructure at Marvell Semiconductor, Inc. &ldquo;The security protocol acceleration technology, combined with Marvell&rsquo;s high speed networking technology and state-of-art IOs, provides the optimal solution for SMBs and enterprise networks and security appliances. With CPU and IO virtualization support, the ARMADA 7K and ARMADA 8K SoC families are ideally suited for the data center and edge virtual CPE (vCPE) appliances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvell&rsquo;s ARMADA 8K and ARMADA 7K integration with our hardware IP technology, INSIDE Secure&rsquo;s high speed IPsec and TLS Security Packet Engine, illustrates our ability to offer best-in-class products for top tier vendors. We facilitate an easier deployment and use of our embedded security technology,&rdquo; said Andrew McLennan, executive vice-president of INSIDE Secure&rsquo;s Mobile Security Division. &ldquo;We are proud to be supporting the ODP API defined by the Linaro community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To maximize overall application performance, the advanced architecture of the Marvell-INSIDE solution offloads packet transformation. Additionally, INSIDE Secure&rsquo;s Security Packet Engines enable efficient multi Gigabit IPsec and TLS security protocol processing with maximum CPU offload to handle full line speed encrypted communication.</p>
<p>Marvell&rsquo;s ARMADA 8040 SoC, embedded with INSIDE Secure&rsquo;s Security Packet Engine running ODP, will be demonstrated jointly at Linaro Connect on Sept. 30, 2016 at the JW Marriott Resort and Spa Hotel in Las Vegas.</p>
