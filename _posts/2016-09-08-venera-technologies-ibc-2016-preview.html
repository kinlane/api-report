<p class="responsiveNews">At IBC 2016, Venera will highlight the following major enhancements to Pulsar:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">1.Â Â Â Â DCP/IMF verification. The verification for DCP and IMF packages have been enhanced by including various integrity checks. <br />2.Â Â Â Â DCP Encryption. Pulsar can work with encrypted DCP packages. Pulsar can decrypt these packages and perform its full analysis capabilities. <br />3.Â Â Â Â Report Editing. Users can now review the analysis reports and edit them as needed. Specific error entries can be removed if needed and custom comments can also be added. <br />4.Â Â Â Â Integrated Media Player. Users can now review the Pulsar analysis results with the integrated GrayMeta IRIS player. The review can be performed on a desktop or via SDI output. The IRIS player can be directly invoked from the analysis report, which allows users to directly review the problem location for manual inspection. <br />5.Â Â Â Â 6x real-time HD analysis performance. Pulsarâs performance has been further enhanced and an HD file can now be processed up to 6x real-time speeds. Pulsar has already been leading the industry with its performance and this upgrade sets the benchmark even higher. <br />6.Â Â Â Â International language support. Pulsar now supports localization for Japanese and Korean languages. This makes it easy for Japanese/Korean users to work with Pulsar as they prefer to work with their local language rather than English. <br />7.Â Â Â Â Baseband checks. New video baseband checks for detection of âCamera Dead Pixelsâ and âShort scenesâ have been added. <br />8.Â Â Â Â Loudness correction. Pulsar now supports correction for loudness of encoded audio formats such as MPEG audio in a wide range of formats such as MXF, GXF, QuickTime, MPEG Transport stream, and MPEG Program stream. <br />9.Â Â Â Â User Interface. A variety of user interface enhancements have been implemented which significantly improves the ease of user interaction with the Pulsar system. These enhancements include complete removal of Java applets, improved search filters and sorting for efficient management of complete jobs archives.</p>
