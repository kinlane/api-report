<p><a href="http://www.clearterra.com/">ClearTerra&reg;</a> today announced the timeline for the latest release in their LocateXT product line. LocateXT Version 1.3 is scheduled for release early this summer, but customers can get a sneak peek at the GEOINT 2016 Symposium being held 15-18 May in Orlando, FL. LocateXT software discovers &amp; extracts geocoordinates, place names, and other critical information within unstructured data and places it instantly into Desktop, Server, and Cloud-based geospatial platforms.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The LocateXT 1.3 release has several enhancements for improved workflows working with unstructured data content to include &ldquo;drag &amp; drop&rdquo; functionality for working with KML viewers such as the new Esri&reg; ArcGIS&reg; Earth product, recognition of geo-tagged images, and advanced wizards for working with complicated datasets like social media.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Many of these enhancements will also be available in the LocateXT ArcGIS for Server product and LocateXT Application Programming Interface (API).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Another reason to visit ClearTerra at the GEOINT 2016 Symposium is to be among the first to see newly developed technology ClearTerra is working on as it plans to unveil a new product line in the near future enhancing the capability for searching geospatial data attributes. &ldquo;As geospatial context becomes more critical, these new capabilities will enable analysts to work faster and more efficiently with big data sets from Open Source and Social Media,&rdquo; said Howard Gleason, VP of Technology for ClearTerra.</p>

Additionally, we are seeing a lot of interest as we continue to expand our core technology to the server-side and make it widely available for users by leveraging web-mapping technology platforms,&rdquo; said Jeff Wilson, Vice President of Sales for ClearTerra.</p>
