<p>The <a href="http://www.usitc.gov/">U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC)</a> has released a new report called Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, with a section in the report called "Increasing Collaboration and Integration in Online Services&mdash;The Economic Contributions of Application Programming Interfaces".</p>
<p>The report is the second of two compiled by committee, with the first report, Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 1 published last year. The earlier report laid the groundwork for the second report by providing an overview of trends in U.S. digital trade, describing the ways digital trade facilitates trade in other sectors, and approaches for estimating the economic impact of digital trade on the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Now with Digital Trade in the U.S. and Global Economies, Part 2 the commission is focusing on the value of U.S. digital trade and the potential growth of this trade, providing insight into the broader linkages and contributions of digital trade to the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The report that includes a survey of U.S. firms in industries particularly involved in digital trade, also examines the effects of notable barriers and impediments to digital trade, and presents case studies that examine the importance of digital trade to selected U.S. industries.</p>
