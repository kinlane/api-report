<p><a href="https://www.imsglobal.org">IMS Global Learning Consortium (IMS Global)</a>, the world leader in EdTech interoperability and innovation today announced final release of two specifications that leverage the widely adopted Learning Tools Interoperability&reg; (LTI&reg;). LTI Content-Item Message 1.0 and Membership Service 1.0 enable features that make integration of learning tools with learning platforms more seamless than LTI on its own. IMS Global is recommending adoption of both of these new specifications by all providers of LTI-enabled products.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">LTI Content-Item Message 1.0 extends the LTI toolbox by adding a new message type to streamline the process of setting up an LTI tool link. This new message type enables external (LTI) tools to appear in the same way that internal tools do. Using Content-Item Message will eliminate a prime reason for custom integrations.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Membership Service 1.0 is an LTI specification enabling instructors to automate the provision of student lists via LTI to an external tool. LTI does not pass user information in its default configuration. Using Membership Service user information can be passed in a safe and secure manner. The Membership feature also allows instructors to be given a display showing the activity of all their students.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;These two specifications build off the success of LTI to further enhance the user experience for students when navigating among instructional applications and significantly streamlines workflows for instructors,&rdquo; says Mark Leuba, Vice President of Product Management of IMS Global. &ldquo;The release of these specifications move us closer to achieving seamless interoperability to enable teaching and learning innovation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Developer implementation guides, GitHub API Code Libraries, and conformance testing harnesses, as well as procurement and administrator guides for institutions, have been initiated.</p>
