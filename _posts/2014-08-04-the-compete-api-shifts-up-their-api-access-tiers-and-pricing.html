<p><a href="https://www.compete.com/">Compete</a>, the digital insight data provider&nbsp;just announced that they will be changing up their pricing, in a continued effort to dial in their monetization strategy around their API.</p>
<p>Compete used to give you X many credits(depending on access tier), and each of their data types (ie. Unique Visitors, Page Views, Attention, Visits, Average Stay, Compete Rank, Pages per Visit, Visits per Person, Daily Reach, Daily Attention, or Age/Income/Gender Demographics) would have a different cost, making some data types much more costly than others.</p>
<p>As of 8/1/2014, you will get a certain amount of credits (depending on access tier), and you will be able to apply across any of the data types, with the freemium Compete API tier giving 3000 credits that you can use in any way you want.</p>

<p>Compete technically offers 4 access tiers for their data: Free, Intro - $199 / month, Advanced - $649 / month, and Advanced+ Custom Plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with the metering and pricing changes, Compete has also release a new API developer dashboard, where you can manage your apps, and see the usage detail against each API endpoint.</p>
<p>The monetization of API resources is an ongoing process, something that is about always trying to find the sweet spot for API consumers, constantly working to understand what their needs and behavior are, around your valuable API driven resources.</p>
<p>This evolutionary process monetize an API is evident in the Compete API ecosystem, as well as with the very competitive world of cloud computing, where the giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Red Hat are battling it out for market share by adjusting their access levels, and pricing--something that will continue to be a major part of the API economy.</p>
