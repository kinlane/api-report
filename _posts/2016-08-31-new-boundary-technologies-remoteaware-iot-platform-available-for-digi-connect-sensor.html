The Connect Sensor is a battery-powered, enterprise-ready, cellular gateway solution for wireless connectivity at locations with either no power or low power. In offering a plug-and-play solution, Digi Connect Sensor allows for remote sensor monitoring to be deployed in environments previously considered too harsh, remote or not economically viable.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">RemoteAware is a highly configurable enterprise IoT application platform for monitoring a broad range of sensors without custom software development. RemoteAware applications provide customers with a âsingle pane of glassâ view of all their remote assets from any web browser. Costly physical site visits to check asset conditions are eliminated. Users receive text, e-mail and/or voice notifications when an asset requires immediate attention based on user-configurable thresholds for sensor readings.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe are pleased to add the Connect Sensor to the family of Digi products supported in our RemoteAware application,â said Kim Pearson, CEO of New Boundary Technologies. âThe Connect Sensor is ideal for applications in oil & gas, agriculture, water & energy, and industrial automation. Combining the Digi Connect Sensor with the RemoteAware application platform provides customers and solution providers with out-of-the-box end-to-end secure solutions.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Digi Connect Sensor key features include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Flexible power source options: Features a long-lasting, non-rechargeable battery with two to three-year average life, sleep mode to conserve power between sensor readings and the option to power from an external source using the internal battery as backup power. As a result, users have the flexibility to make the device self-powered, or take advantage of existing power supplies, including solar.</li>
<li>Cellular choice: For global connectivity, Connect Sensor is available in 3G HSPA+ with 2G fallback. North American users can also choose an LTE CAT 1 version.</li>
<li>Supports LTE CAT 1: With support for LTE CAT 1, the band specifically created for IoT and M2M communications, Connect Sensor devices are highly efficient, require less power and are optimized for data transfer.</li>
<li>Sensor variety and flexibility: Multiple I/O options and simultaneous connections offer solution flexibility to address multiple sensor-based environments. Connect Sensor can work with virtually any 4/20mA, Analog Out, Digital Out or Pulsed Output sensor, and can power multiple external sensors, eliminating the need for external supplies or batteries.</li>
<li>Enterprise-grade security: Security may be implemented at the device, transport and platform level.</li>
<li>Appropriate for harsh environments: Features weather-proof NEMA 4 enclosure to protect sensors from the elements, as well as ATEX Group 2 and UL Class 1 Division 2 ratings.</li>
<li>Increased awareness and customized reporting: Integration with Digi Device Cloud provides visibility and centralized management for all Connect Sensor devices; Device Cloud also serves as the platform for sensor data collection.</li>
<li>Increased levels of customization: Configurable read/report intervals and customizable alarms provide alerts when sensor value is above or below threshold levels.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">New Boundary Technologies RemoteAware application key features include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Remote asset visibility: Responsive web user interface using any browser on smart phones, tablets, laptops and desktop computers. No applications to install and manage.</li>
<li>Configurable alerts: Receive text, e-mail, and/or voice message alerts when any sensor reading exceeds user-configurable thresholds.</li>
<li>Scalable: No limit on the number of monitored assets and sensors.</li>
<li>Secure: Proven, industry standard end-to-end encryption and authentication technologies protect data confidentiality.</li>
<li>Private label applications: RemoteAware applications can be private labeled for solution providers and enterprise customers.</li>
<li>Open API:The RemoteAware platform has a simple API for easy integration with back-office systems and 3rd party applications.</li>
