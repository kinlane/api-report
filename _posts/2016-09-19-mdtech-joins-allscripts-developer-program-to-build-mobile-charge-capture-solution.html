<p><a href="http://www.mdtech.com/">Medical Design Technologies (MDTECH)</a> announced today it has joined the award-winning Allscripts Developer Program (ADP) to build integration using the Allscripts Open API. The planned integration will enable Allscripts physicians, mid-level providers and nurses to electronically capture charges at the point-of-care and seamlessly synchronize those charges directly into their Allscripts system.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Anytime a charging provider is outside of their Allscripts eco-system, they can use MD Coder as the gateway between Allscripts and the other system holding critical patient information. When a provider has to see patients in various inpatient facilities, MD Coder can seamlessly capture that patient encounter and seamlessly sends it in real time to their Allscripts system to be billed entirely, eliminating any possible charge lag or lost charges. In addition, MD Coder can be integrated into various inpatient systems, nursing facilities and dialysis centers, pulling pertinent patient demographic information and passing this through to the Allscripts system.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ADP partners benefit from a robust set of developer tools and documentation available on the Allscripts Developer Portal. Allscripts also provides technical support and workshops for all developers integrating with its Open API and has shared data with third parties more than a billion times.</p>
