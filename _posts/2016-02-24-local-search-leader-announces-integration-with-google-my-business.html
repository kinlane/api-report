<p><a href="http://www.rioseo.com">Rio SEO</a>, the leader in automated local and mobile search software, is pleased to announce the integration of the recently launched Google My Business API with the Rio OpenLocal software platform. This new development grants Rio SEO&rsquo;s 100+ multi-location retailers and service providers enhanced access at improved speeds to the highly popular search engine for sharing key local information, such as location and hours of operation.</p>
<p>This version of the Google My Business API aims to ease the connection between multi-location businesses and customers, whether they&rsquo;re using Google Search, Google Maps, or Google Plus. Rio SEO software creates and manages business location listings with name, address, phone number, category and business hours. The improved Google My Business API also includes new functionality to:</p>
<ul>
<li>manage special hours, </li>
<li>mark permanently closed locations as such, </li>
<li>search and filter locations by category, </li>
<li>set a service area radius, </li>
<li>and add managers to locations and business accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rio SEO integration empowers enterprises using the software to more rapidly update their Google My Business content for multiple locations and to provide location-specific information. Multi-location retailers and brands worldwide are better able to meet consumer needs when they are in-market to purchase products and services locally.</p>
<p>"The Google My Business API integration strengthens our company&rsquo;s ties with leading edge technology companies,&rdquo; said Dema Zlotin, CEO of Rio SEO. He noted that the Rio OpenLocal platform has been integrated with Google for years, allowing enterprise brands to update local information across multiple locations.</p>
<p>Zlotin added, &ldquo;Seeing as Google garners over 100 billion searches a month, integrating its My Business API into the Rio SEO platform empowers brands to provide more relevant and accurate local content in search results for mobile consumers, at scale and with respect for the increasing need for enterprises to control their company&rsquo;s data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brands with 50 locations or more are invited to take advantage of a free local SEO audit report from Rio SEO, to determine their listing accuracy and mobile readiness at RioSEO.com.</p>
