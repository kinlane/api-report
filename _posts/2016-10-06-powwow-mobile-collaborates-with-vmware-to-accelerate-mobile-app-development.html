Together, PowWow Mobile and VMware will offer enterprises the ability to create and deploy secure apps for mobile users with unmatched speed, simplicity and economy.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âThe consumerization of mobility within the enterprise is re-defining business operations and processes like never before, and IT and line of business need tools to meet these challengesâ, said Gregory Lehrer, director of Technology Alliances VMware. âThe collaboration between PowWow Mobile and VMware simplifies how organizations design, build and deploy their mission critical mobile apps, and VMware is thrilled that a leading enterprise mobility platform such as PowWow Mobile is helping us to drive this initiative.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The PowWow Mobile solution is based upon revolutionary technology that is disrupting the speed, complexity and economics commonly associated with delivering productivity enhancing apps to an increasingly mobile-first workforce. The PowWow SmartUX Platform accelerates mobile app development by transforming existing Windows and web applications and workflows into modern mobile experiences or; by creating net new apps that connect to any third-party data source, API or SQL. With PowWow Mobile, users can easily design and deploy personalized, intelligent and secure apps that run anywhere, on any device (PC, laptop, tablet, phone or watch) and any OS (iOS, Android, Windows 10, or HTML5).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âMobilizing core business processes is key to enabling a productive workforce,â said PowWow Mobile CEO, Kia Behnia. âHowever, the vast majority of companies have yet to deploy meaningful enterprise apps beyond email, calendar and contacts due to the time, cost and complexity of traditional enterprise mobile app development. Enterprises can leverage the PowWow Mobile SmartUX Platform to deliver apps that transcend mobile device families and form factors in weeks, without changes to existing applications and infrastructure, and a total cost of ownership that is unparalleled in the industry. In collaboration with VMware companies can also simplify the management and security of mobile apps to increase productivity and drive business growth unlike ever before.â</p>
