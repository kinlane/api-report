<p><a href="https://www.activedemand.com">ActiveDEMAND</a>, an integrated marketing platform created by parent company JumpDEMAND for digital marketing, now offers support for Zapier Triggers. Exposing the powerful outgoing web API through Zapier makes it easy to push a wealth of marketing data and tracking information into 1000&rsquo;s of applications whenever an important prospect activity happens within ActiveDEMAND. JumpDEMAND representatives make it clear that while ActiveDEMAND was already a powerful platform, this implantation of Zapier Triggers now provides digital marketing agencies and businesses a competitive advantage through increased integration.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;In a nutshell, Triggers are one of the Zapier building blocks that power integrations,&rdquo; explains Sean Leonard, CEO of JumpDEMAND. &ldquo;Triggers watch for important events in ActiveDEMAND, and then kick off a sequence of Searches and Actions. These combos &ndash; called &lsquo;Zaps&rsquo; &ndash; complete tasks automatically. As a marketing automation platform, ActiveDEMAND offers a range of new triggers that provide useful integration for many applications, including new contact creation, webpage/form submissions, incoming phone calls/text messages, online chat sessions, email openings, link clicks and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Examples of &ldquo;Zaps&rdquo; using these new Triggers include:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Updating users CRM when a prospect has reached a critical stage of engagement;</li>
<li>Updating users accounting software whenever a deal is won;</li>
<li>Updating users Google Sheets tracking when new contacts are added to ActiveDEMAND; and countless more possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to JumpDEMAND representatives like Leonard, Zaps like these can be created using hundreds of web apps, all without knowing anything about code.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Through the power of ActiveDEMAND, Zaps can be run automatically without any additional effort on the part of marketers,&rdquo; concludes Leonard. &ldquo;With Zapier taking care of repetitive tasks, those same marketers and other business professionals get to focus on the exciting challenges that need their attention. There&rsquo;s no need to hire expensive developers or spend time building complex service integrations themselves.&rdquo;</p>
