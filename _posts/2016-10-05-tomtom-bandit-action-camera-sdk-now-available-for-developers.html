<p>TomTom (TOM2) today announces the availability of its TomTom Bandit Action Camera Software Development Kit (SDK). This includes the Camera Media Server API, unique MP4 file formats as well as iOS and Android&trade; software libraries - all designed for developers to easily harness and use TomTom Bandit&rsquo;s software capabilities.</p>
<p>The TomTom Bandit is an action camera with integrated motion sensors including GPS, accelerometer, gyro and pressure sensor that record video and data in an MP4 video file. This action data is used to tag interesting moments, called <em>highlights,</em> which allow users to quickly find their best moments from hours of recorded video.</p>
<p>Developers can now start building upon the Camera Media Server API which includes a live viewfinder, video manipulation, file management, transcoding capabilities, and a lot more &ndash; all by connecting to TomTom Bandit. With accompanying libraries for both iOS and Android&trade;, developers will be able to quickly integrate TomTom Bandit technology into their application and build great experiences using smart video recording.</p>
<p>Emirates Team New Zealand is the first partner to deploy the TomTom Bandit SDK, to improve their training for the America&rsquo;s Cup taking place in June 2017. The action data recorded in their training and the ability to easily edit footage allows for faster feedback, with enhanced data from TomTom Bandit including speed, acceleration and heart-rate.*</p>
<p>Peter Frans Pauwels, Co-founder of TomTom said: &ldquo;The TomTom Bandit action camera is a great example of how we&nbsp;translate high-end technology into an easy-to-use consumer product. With the&nbsp;TomTom Bandit SDK&nbsp;we are now making this unique technology available to developers in an easy way. We are very excited that Emirates Team New Zealand chose TomTom Bandit and the TomTom Bandit SDK to help&nbsp;prepare for the America&rsquo;s Cup in June 2017.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adding TomTom Bandit technology to our training routine has allowed us to improve the quality of debriefs while vastly reducing time between trainings and feedback. In the past we spent hours downloading footage and selecting the right sections, after an already long day of training. Now, with TomTom Bandit we have visual feedback, when training is still top of mind. We have found a dream partner in TomTom as we both continuously push boundaries of technology as far as possible, with the ultimate aim to be in a winning position,&rdquo; said Grant Dalton, Emirates Team New Zealand Chief Executive.</p>
