<p><a href="http://www.entrata.com">Entrata</a>, the multi-family industry&rsquo;s fastest growing technology provider, has partnered with IDScan.net to bring new and innovative ID scanning capabilities to its SiteTablet mobile leasing solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">IDScan.net&rsquo;s ID parsing software development kit enables companies like Entrata to incorporate driver&rsquo;s license reading and parsing capabilities into its own applications.  The state of the art technology  does not require Internet connectivity to scan ID&rsquo;s and it parses the data locally on each device, resulting in much faster processing speeds.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Both companies joined forces in October last year, with positive results coming in this quarter from existing clients.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The new ID scanning feature is receiving excellent feedback from clients in the multi-family industry,&rdquo; said Joshua Renberg, product manager, Entrata.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Since releasing the new ID scanning feature, Entrata has seen usage and adoption rates more than double for one of the multi-family&rsquo;s largest companies using SiteTablet.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The SiteTablet app was originally developed by Entrata to provide a connected mobile solution to the antiquated leasing process of the multi-family industry.  In the past, leasing agents relied heavily on paper brochures, printed availability and pricing sheets and paper leases.  SiteTablet allows agents to connect directly to their Property Management Software so they have real-time access to all of the information they need to do their job effectively.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We chose IDScan.net's software to quickly scan driver&rsquo;s licenses in an effort to streamline and efficiently capture prospective residents&rsquo; information during the leasing process,&rdquo; said Renberg.&ldquo;This change to the process is much more efficient in time and reduces errors in transposing details such as name, address and license number.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our Company is pleased to provide innovative ID scanning capabilities to companies like Entrata who are looking for a fast, accurate and efficient method of collecting ID information. We are excited to welcome Entrata as a customer and look forward to a long and mutually beneficial relationship with their team,&rdquo; said IDScan.net&rsquo;s CEO Denis Petrov. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been providing the most up to date and cost-effective ID reading technology to the commercial market for over 13 years, and it&rsquo;s great to see the enhancement it has brought to Entrata&rsquo;s SiteTablet.&rdquo;</p>
