Clarifai has raised $41.25 million in combined funding to date.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The new funding will be used to accelerate the expansion of Clarifaiâs engineering and business teams, hire key research talent and continue rapid artificial intelligence innovation with new product releases. Clarifai is the foremost independent artificial intelligence and machine learning platform that can be used by any developer and business.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âClarifai was built upon the belief that everyone should have the power to use artificial intelligence, regardless of their budget, infrastructure or skill level, in order to improve their products and our quality of life,â said Clarifai founder and CEO Matt Zeiler. âAs an independent company, we have the unique ability to move quickly and innovate at a more consistent and rapid pace, all while solely focusing on leveraging data for each partnerâs specific business needs. This new funding enables us to supercharge our innovation and continue our mission to create an AI platform that makes powerful AI tools available to the masses.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âWe're at the beginning of a long, exciting, and impactful era of innovation using AI,â said Matt Murphy, Managing Director at Menlo Ventures. âFrom day one, Clarifai has focused on the big vision of enabling anyone to unlock the power of AI. Matt and his team are uniquely positioned to deliver on this vision and Menlo Ventures is thrilled to be backing them.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">This funding news comes on the heels of Clarifaiâs latest product releases: Custom Training and Visual Search. Custom Training puts the power to train artificial intelligence into everyoneâs hands, allowing anyone to âteachâ Clarifaiâs visual recognition API new concepts in a matter of seconds regardless of their technical ability. Visual Search allows any user to easily organize, access, or recommend their images or products by visual similarity and/or keyword, enabling developers and businesses to better connect their users with what theyâre looking for. This advanced technology, previously only available to large tech companies, is now available to anyone through the Clarifai API.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Figuratively doubling down, and literally quadrupling down, is our strongest vote of confidence not only in Clarifai's execution to date and Zeiler's unabashed hunger to drive Clarifai as the leader in the emergent AI space - but also in our conviction that a stand-alone company needs to exist that democratizes AI outside the confines of the mainstay technorati,â said Lux Capitalâs Zavain Dar.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To date, Clarifai has amassed a suite of clients that range from Fortune 500 companies to startups and small development teams, including Buzzfeed, Trivago, 500px, StyleMePretty, and many more. Clarifaiâs visual recognition API recognizes more than 11,000 different concepts in photos and videos, and also provides domain-specific recognition tools, including the Not Safe For Work adult content moderation model, which can recognize potentially offensive nudity; the Travel model, which can recognize travel-related concepts like âhot tub,â âkids area,â and âindoor swimming pool;â and most recently, the Food model, which can recognize food images down to the ingredient level.</p>
