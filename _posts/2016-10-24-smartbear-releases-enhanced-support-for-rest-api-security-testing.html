API, focusing on the security of APIs. The release comes at a time when security risks forÂ APIs in particularÂ have become a major issue, as many enterprises continue to move digital assets to the cloud. Experts too have identified API security as a major link in the chain leading to other security incidents including those with Buffer, AppleÂ iCloudÂ and Adobe. SmartBearâs Ready! API is a unified set of graphical and code-based testing tools that includes Secure Pro for dynamic API security testing, SoapUI NG Pro for functional testing, LoadUI NG Pro for load testing, ServiceV Pro for API service virtualization and TestServer for Continuous Integration environments.</p>
<p>âMost of the APIs in the cloud are based on the popular REST methodology, and these are universally accessible and open to threats from hackers,â said John Purcell, Vice President of Products, API Readiness at SmartBear. âIt has become a priority for organizations to determine and fix security loopholes in their REST APIs, and this new update to Secure Pro allows organizations to do that. With most of the vulnerable content in REST API being transported in the message body, Secure Pro now provides thorough scanning of RESTful payloads. These scans are easy to create and are pre-configured to find the most commonly found vulnerabilities.â</p>
<p>In addition, SmartBear also made major productivity improvements to SoapUI NG Pro. Groovy scripting capabilities have been enhanced to include script debugging, a feature request from many customers.</p>
<p>âAfter evaluating the new version of SoapUI NG Pro,Â the debuggerÂ is an excellent tool, simplifying my workflow and opening up the possibility of taking full control of the test cases,â said Stefan Poon, Senior Test Consultant at CAGÂ Senseus, an IT services company based in Sweden.</p>
<p>With Ready! API 1.9, organizations committed to API enhancement and API quality can now integrate Virts fully with Continuous Integration processes in ServiceV Pro through automatic deploy, start, stop and un-deploy. They can also now measure the impact of load tests on Oracle DB servers by monitoring server parameters in LoadUI NG Pro.</p>
