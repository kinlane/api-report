These interfaces are used to connect cloud services and applications from different vendors to create a common ecosystem.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Â </span>The problem is that companies regularly change their APIs. Dropbox just forced 300,000 app developers to migrate to a new API version. Every app using the Dropbox API, in which a developer is not willing to invest a week of costly development time, will break. Unfortunately this use case is the rule rather than the exception.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">On the one hand companies provide an open API to support a connected world and on the other hand destroy it by regularly changing them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="https://cloudrail.com">CloudRail</a>, whose API integration solutions for apps are used by millions of users every day, has built a solution to this problem. Called API Change Management, the product automatically identifies API changes and maintains them for app developers to keeps critical integrations working. It helps developers to keep track of API changes and let them upgrade their integrations in less than 10 minutes instead of days, resulting in significant development costs savings but also keeps their customers happy with stable apps. Now developers have more control over their apps that ever before.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">âIâm frustrated that companies are constantly changing their APIs. While I understand it is to improve the overall integration between my app and their service, it is done in a way that costs me time and moneyâ says Lam-Thao Ha from cm3p development. âMultiply a week fix across the nine APIs I integrate, it has an impact on my profit margin. Finally a company built tools focus on me the developer and my needs.â</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The CloudRail solution is freely available for open source and non commercial apps. The Commercial offering starts at 19â¬ per month.</span></p>
