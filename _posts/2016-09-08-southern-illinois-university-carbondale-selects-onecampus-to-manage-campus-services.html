<p>Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU Carbondale) has selected OneCampus from rSmart, an <a href="https://www.internet2.edu/products-services/cloud-services-applications/onecampus-rsmart/">Internet2 NET+ offering</a>, to modernize the way students, faculty, and staff find and access campus services, information and applications from any device. OneCampus, a service discovery portal with lightweight technology designed to help schools move away from heavy, expensive, locally-managed software, was selected by SIU to serve more than 22,000 students, faculty and staff.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Founded in 1869 as the state&rsquo;s second teachers college, SIU Carbondale is a nationally ranked public research university and regional economic catalyst that embraces a unique tradition of access and opportunity, inclusive excellence, innovation in research and creativity, and outstanding teaching focused on nurturing student success.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">OneCampus provides colleges, universities and school districts with an innovative solution for organizing their web-based services, giving students, faculty and staff swifter access to campus services such as grades, calendars, email, events, curriculum, tutoring services, and much more. SIU Carbondale is accessing OneCampus through Internet2 NET+ -- a research and education (R&amp;E) community-driven initiative in which institutions and cloud service providers work through a rigorous peer-driven evaluation process to develop offerings that maximize deployment efficiencies and minimize the business and legal challenges, financial costs, and technology risks of migrating from on-campus to cloud-based solutions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">John D. Ahrens, director of enterprise applications at SIU Carbondale explained, &ldquo;We recognized that today&rsquo;s students are tech experts. They are accustomed to and expect to have quick and easy access to the tools they need and the information they want. In this age of mobility, they also want it right now -- on their phones, not to mention on all of their other devices. The OneCampus solution, branded as SalukiNet here at SIU Carbondale, gives us the ability to consolidate complex campus functions in one convenient place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Unlike traditional portals, OneCampus features a Google-like search, ratings/reviews to effectively analyze what services are being used and satisfaction levels, and dynamic categories such as &ldquo;most popular&rdquo; to promote service discovery. Administrators can also convey important, time-sensitive information to a large audience through announcements, alerts, and featured tasks.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">OneCampus connects with an institution&rsquo;s campus authentication system and sits on top of existing systems, directing users to disparate services through a centralized point, without affecting the underlying business units or processes. As a result, its implementation as well as ongoing updates are fast and easy, and the responsibility of maintenance can be shared by various stakeholders. OneCampus has powerful APIs that allow other applications to easily push data from popular campus systems such as SIS, LMS or finance system.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">rSmart CEO Tony Potts added, &ldquo;Progressive schools such as SIU Carbondale are searching for a cost-effective replacement for their legacy portal that offers a dynamic approach to meeting the needs of their current and future students. Students today have higher standards and they expect applications that &lsquo;just work.&rsquo; They want technology that fits their lifestyle and doesn&rsquo;t slow them down. SIU has taken the step to support their students and faculty with OneCampus. rSmart is thrilled to welcome SIU to the growing community of OneCampus users.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The OneCampus Internet2 NET+ service is the result of the collaboration between seven universities, Internet2, and rSmart to provide a unique offering to the higher education community. Technology leaders from Indiana University, University of Utah, University of Maryland, University of Pittsburgh, Clemson University, University of Nebraska-Omaha, and BYU-Idaho helped guide and shape the validated solution.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Since bringing this next generation portal to all higher education institutions, rSmart has worked with dozens of schools across the nation to deploy OneCampus. Adopting institutions and members of the advisory board play in a key role in refining the product roadmap and sharing best practices.</p>
