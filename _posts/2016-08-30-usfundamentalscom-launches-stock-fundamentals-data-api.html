The API provides similar data in a format that is more convenient for comparisons and analysis, as well as automated processing.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Customers can use the API to retrieve the fundamental data for specific companies or get the indicator values across all reports. For example, indicators such as net income, revenue, assets and liabilities, cash provided by operating, investing, and financing activities and others. In total the data contains 8,526 unique indicators, which follow the definitions from US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Though only a limited number of indicators is suitable for comparisons across multiple companies.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">What sets the API apart from existing options, is a permissive data license and API usage terms. This allows customers to build upon this data, redistribute and re-sell it if necessary.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The data is based on company reports submitted to SEC in XBRL format, which is a machine readable format for business information. All companies reporting with SEC have been required to submit XBRL filings since Jun 15, 2011. Five years of data is available at the moment.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The API provides indicator data in CSV format, suitable for analysis in Excel. For automated processing the API includes an update feed, making it easy to have a fully updated local copy of the data. Using the API saves a lot of time and resources compared to working with raw XBRL data.</p>
