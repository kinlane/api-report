<p>A sales team in Orlando, back-end developers in Jakarta, and executive management in Berlin. Does this organizational structure sound familiar? With the rise of technology, businesses are finding that breaking from the traditional office mold and giving employees the option to work from anywhere in the world can have some serious benefits. That flexibility has shown to keep employees motivated while saving on rent for office spaces (CFOs really love that last one). While there are many upsides to this structure, it&rsquo;s not always easy to pull off. Businesses need to make a careful decision about who they can rely on for their global conferencing infrastructure so they can keep the communication flowing between teams and across oceans.</p>
<p>Take PM Group for example: an architectural and engineering firm with over 2,100 employees spread over 18 locations worldwide. To deliver their best work to clients, teams must maintain excellent communication, regardless of where they&rsquo;re based. PM Group leverages Voxbone&rsquo;s direct inward dialing (DID) numbers for its internal conferencing, so employees in different locations can set up a conference call and work as if they were around the same table. All of Voxbone&rsquo;s numbers are maintained on a private global network and available on demand, so PM Group can quickly provision local numbers for its employees.</p>
<p>PM Group is just one company that&rsquo;s seen the benefits of having employees out of the office. In the United States alone, the telecommuting population has increased 103 percent since 2005, according to research firm Global Workplace Analytics, and it shows no signs of slowing down. Millennials in particular are fond of this option, and now that they&rsquo;re the dominant generation in the workforce, you can expect to see more businesses looking for the best way to support their remote teams. Voxbone&rsquo;s reach in 59 countries and 9,000 cities makes it a great choice for businesses who want to give global teams a local touch.</p>
