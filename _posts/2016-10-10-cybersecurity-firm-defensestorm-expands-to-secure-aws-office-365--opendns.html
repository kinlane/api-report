The product expansion stems from growing concern in the financial sector on how best to secure both ground and cloud assets against todayâs threat actors.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âFinancial institutions are increasingly relying on cloud business productivity applications and services such as AWS and Office 365. While adoption of these productivity applications is accelerating, unfortunately so is the risk factor tied to them. Many cloud users are not aware that their providers have a shared responsibility model for cloud security. Continuous monitoring of your cloud infrastructure for security events is crucial - which is why we are pleased to now offer financial organizations a new level of security,â said DefenseStorm's Chief Product Officer, Edgardo Nazario.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With an innovative and patent-pending technology suite, financial institutions can use the DefenseStorm platform to aggregate on-premise, colocated data center, and cloud logs into a single system for comprehensive cybersecurity management. The cloud has become essential to running a modern financial institution and as more in the industry move to a hybrid cloud setup, the new features have been eagerly anticipated.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âCloud security is different than traditional network security, and as a fast-paced tech company, Tealium needed a unified security data platform to manage our entire cybersecurity program. DefenseStorm is the fastest, easiest to use solution we could find,â said Tealium CEO, Jeff Lunsford.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">DefenseStorm works diligently to provide solutions and pricing tailored to the unique needs of banks and credit unions. Financial institutions will pay a single, asset-based, fee to affordably secure their entire network; something DefenseStorm feels strongly about.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âOur mission is to aggregate event data across all cybersecurity tools and business productivity applications for banks and credit unions, which can then be linked to controls and processes that allow security analysts to meet their intended security posture,â said Nazario. âIt also allows executives to prove to their CEO, board and regulators that they are secure and compliant with evolving FFIEC cybersecurity requirements - all without having to pay extra to do so.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A look at the new features reveals exciting news for security analysts, as the robust enhancements solve the universal problem of getting relevant alerts on potential security issues within the cloud infrastructure. Highlights include:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>AWS </strong><br />DefenseStorm Cloud watches and alerts on critical parts of your AWS cloud, like API access, configuration, applications and access management.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AWS CloudTrail events are complicated. To know what one should look for requires a complete and comprehensive list of events to monitor. The DefenseStorm platform ships with a standard Trigger Library that protects their customers; which includes the required and correct alerts right out of the box.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Office 365 </strong><br />With this new feature, customers can write alerts that warn a security analysts about Office 365 security events. Analysts will also be able to correlate Office 365 events with other events in their network - or other cloud services.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Customers can leverage all of DefenseStormâs existing technologies; such as PatternScout, ThreatMatch and Alert Inbox, to detect and (when needed) remediate Indicators of Compromise (IOCâs) that stem from events received via Office 365.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>OpenDNS </strong><br />The feature allows DefenseStorm to correlate OpenDNS logs to the rest of an organizationâs network events; giving insight into what DefenseStorm customers' users are doing both when they are inside and outside of the the corporate network.</p>
