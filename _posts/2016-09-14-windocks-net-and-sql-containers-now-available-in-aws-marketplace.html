<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/windocks_logo.jpg" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="http://www.windocks.com">WinDocks</a>, the Practical Windows container, announced a no-cost downloadable Community Edition, providing Windows professionals no-cost access to .NET and SQL Server containers using Docker commands. The company also announced availability of WinDocks products in Amazon Web Services Marketplace (AWS Marketplace), including a no-cost virtual machine (VM) based on the WinDocks Community Edition (AWS usage fees apply).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The WinDocks Community Edition includes the full WinDocks features, with a limit of five containers:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Windows Server 2012 with .NET and SQL Server containers using the Docker API and commands;</li>
<li>WinDocks creates containers in seconds, and supports a team of developers or testers on a single VM;</li>
<li>Proven workload portability between on-premises and the AWS Cloud; and</li>
<li>1-ClickÂ® provisioning with a pre-configured AMI in AWS Marketplace</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">WinDocks is based on a port of the Docker Engine, a leading container standard. Using WinDocks containers, organizations can start Docker-based development and operations, and align with Microsoftâs support of the Docker API in Windows Server 2016. Industry surveys show that Windows Server 2012 will continue to grow share-of-usage for the next three to four years (source: http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1289032-survey-when-will-it-departments-adopt-windows-server-2016).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">WinDocks is already used to provide workload portability between on-premises and the cloud. WinDocks has collaborated with NetApp to demonstrate a containerized application that is provisioned in the cloud, using a private ~1 TB database, in just 45 seconds (see https://youtu.be/2IRNx-6d4Oc ).</p>
