<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Bookmarks Gadget</strong><br />The Bookmarks Gadget provides CMS users with quick access to their most visited locations in OU Campus. CMS users can bookmark files, assets, custom reports, and more. Bookmarks are searchable and can be organized in folders, plus reordered via drag-and-drop functionality. To run Custom Reports, administrators can bookmark the results and reports will run each time the bookmark is accessed from the gadget, ensuring up-to-date information.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>OU Campus&trade; for Mobile</strong><br />Released alongside version 10.4, OU Campus&trade; for Mobile allows for on-the-go access to workflow, messaging, reports, and user management.
