<p>Today, a majority of APIs are based on a REST architecture, since its lightweight structure and low use of bandwidth are well suited to a range of web, mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the effectiveness of a REST API is only as good as its design. A new white paper from <a href="http://wso2.com">WSO2</a> provides guidelines, based on proven industry best practices, on how to develop a REST API that reaches Level 2 of the Richardson Maturity Model.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Mastering RESTful APIs</strong><br />The white paper, &ldquo;WSO2 REST API Design Guidelines,&rdquo; was authored by Professor Dr. Frank Leymann, director, Institute of Architecture of Application Systems, University of Stuttgart together with the WSO2 technical team.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The paper begins by explaining the decision to focus Level 2 of the Richardson Maturity Model, which grades APIs according to the constraints of REST, noting that Level 3 is not yet supported by the breadth of accepted best practices as Level 2. It then provides a top-level overview of the major steps that should be followed in creating a RESTful API.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Next, the paper dives into the details of each step and supporting actions, including how to:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Create a data model to describe the data that will be manipulated by the API.</li>
<li>Create a resource model that specifies the resources the API will process, such as atomic, collection, composite, controller, and processing function resources.</li>
<li>Create uniform resource identifiers (URIs), including proper naming and schemes, as well as the host, base path, version, URI templates, and query string.</li>
<li>Specify the representation of each resource, which also requires deciding on a data structure for the information content.</li>
<li>Manipulate resources in the REST method using create, retrieve, update and delete (CRUD) operations that map to the HTTP methods: POST, GET, PUT and DELETE.</li>
<li>Use HTTP headers to provide a vehicle for non-functional properties of REST APIs.</li>
<li>Implement status codes in response messages to provide key information to clients about the status of a request.</li>
<li>Determine any special behaviors that need to be addressed, such as content negotiation, queries, pagination, client-side caching, concurrency control, and long-running requests.</li>
<li>Determine how reporting errors will be handled.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">The paper then examines how to secure resources of the API by making them accessible on a properly designed permission model that prevents the misuse of APIs. Among the approaches examined are HTTP Basic Authentication, Open Authorization (OAuth) tokens, and the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) for a more fine-grained control of access to resources. It then concludes by reviewing the implications of security approaches on API design.</p>
