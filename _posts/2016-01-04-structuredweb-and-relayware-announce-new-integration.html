<p><a href="http://www.structuredweb.com">StructuredWeb</a>, a leading provider of SaaS channel marketing software, and Relayware, a SaaS-based provider of partner relationship management software, today announced a new partnership and integration between the two channel platforms. This new partnership acts to complement the comprehensive solutions offered by both StructuredWeb and Relayware supporting end-to-end visibility and management of channel ecosystems, creating additional benefits for each company&rsquo;s customers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Creating a uniform partner experience is paramount to our core vision of helping vendors and their channel partners improve collaboration and drive top line revenue,&rdquo; says Daniel Nissan, founder and CEO at StructuredWeb. &ldquo;We look forward to continuing this partnership with Relayware to create more intelligent campaigns using data from their PRM, such as MDF and deal registration, to drive more leads and help partners accelerate their sales funnel."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The first implementation of this integration recently went live with Kaspersky Lab, a customer of both StructuredWeb and Relayware.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our work with StructuredWeb and Relayware has brought the Kaspersky Lab Partner Program to the next level and is a key component to the benefits we offer partners,&rdquo; says Jon Whitlock, Vice President of B2B Marketing, Kaspersky Lab North America. &ldquo;With seamless access to the through partner marketing automation system directly from the Partner Portal, partners never miss an opportunity to reach their audience and position themselves as thought leaders in the security space. With the API integration, partner enablement comes full circle to drive leads and ultimately propel our partners&rsquo; businesses forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Well-oiled, high performing channel partner programs require sophisticated technology that enables every aspect of the entire channel lifecycle. This is why companies, like Kaspersky Lab, that are leveraging Relayware and StructuredWeb in tandem have a channel program that is firing on all cylinders,&rdquo; said Relayware Chief Revenue Officer Jim DeSocio. &ldquo;The Relayware &ndash; StructuredWeb partnership maximizes the channel sales and channel marketing value that vendors can get from their channel partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"A critical element in through-partner marketing is the insight suppliers have into their partners&rsquo; marketing capabilities, target customers and industries they serve," says Laz Gonzalez, Group Service Director for channel strategies at SiriusDecisions. "This data is often overlooked, but having a direct API-level integration between StructuredWeb's channel marketing platform and Relayware's PRM ensures suppliers take less of a &lsquo;spray and pray&rsquo; approach and can zero in on their partners strengths and weaknesses, which could translate into huge value for suppliers wanting to drive partner marketing effectiveness."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;This partnership will provide both StructuredWeb and Relayware customers with more effective channel management capabilities and enable more productive, profitable relationships,&rdquo; stated Michael Coscetta, Vice President of Sales &amp; Marketing for StructuredWeb.</p>
