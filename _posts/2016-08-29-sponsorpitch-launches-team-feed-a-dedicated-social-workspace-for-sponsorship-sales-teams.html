<p><a href="https://sponsorpitch.com/">SponsorPitch</a>, the world's leading online platform for sponsorship sales professionals, is pleased to announce the launch of the first social collaboration app specifically designed for sponsorship sales teams. Well known as being the daily &ldquo;go to source&rdquo; for all things sponsorship, SponsorPitch&rsquo;s newest Enterprise feature, Team Feed, helps sales team members get on the same page and communicate seamlessly to ensure the most successful and time-efficient sponsorship outreach strategy.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Team Feed allows team members to share updates with colleagues, tag team members and sponsors in Team Feed conversations, receive sales updates and alerts from other team members, and lookup historical sponsor updates from other team members before reaching out to a prospective sponsor; among other new social features that leverage data on the SponsorPitch platform.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Much more than a cookie-cutter CRM solution, Team Feed uniquely leverages the SponsorPitch real-time sponsorship database, which includes proprietary tracking of new deal flow for thousands of active sponsors. The addition of this exciting new feature follows the successful launch of other Enterprise features including the SponsorPitch Deal API, Deal Export and Reports that help key corporate clients' sales, research and IT departments work together to grow sponsorship sales by most efficiently capitalizing on targeted, real-time sponsorship sales leads.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;There's nothing more costly for sales teams, and more frustrating for marketers, than wasting time because of duplicated sales outreach,&rdquo; said Kris Mathis, Founder and CEO of SponsorPitch. "SponsorPitch's Team Feed allows sales teams to prevent duplicated outreach efforts by seamlessly communicating, while ensuring that the person on your team with the strongest relationship is the one reaching out to a potential sponsor prospect.&rdquo;</p>
