The service enables any size company to harness the power of digital signage without the need to buy expensive hardware and software. Leveraging the Visualz cloud-based management platform, customers can turn virtually any display device into a digital signage display. The service will be sold through channel partners and includes a powerful Partner Portal that enables resellers, integrators, and distributors to provide value-added services in conjunction with Visualz.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âDigital signage is steadily becoming a dominant component of a complete communications strategy,â said Mike Brandofino, CEO of D60. âIn an increasingly digital world, the cost and complexity of implementing digital signage has prohibited many companies from leveraging the technology. Visualz makes it possible for any size organization to bring digital signage to virtually any display device they already own. Visualz takes one minute to set up, two minutes to understand, and five minutes to master.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Visualz was built from the ground up with ease of use and scalability in mind. Utilizing a cloud-based infrastructure backed by AWS, it enables both small and large entities to disseminate information to target audiences quickly and easily. The Visualz development strategy leverages RestFUL API architecture for the management platform and Android for the digital media agents that cache and push the content.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With no hardware or software to buy and no complicated technology to learn, Visualz makes it possible for organizations to distribute content to digital displays throughout their organization, create emergency override messages and manage their digital signage globally for one low monthly fee. With Visualz itâs easy to get your message out, anytime, anywhere.</p>
