<p><a href="http://www.powerschool.com">PowerSchool Group LLC ("PowerSchool")</a> has purchased InfoSnap, Inc. (&ldquo;InfoSnap&rdquo;), the leading provider of cloud-based Online Registration Management and School Choice / Lottery solutions for K-12 public, private and charter schools. The acquisition cements a long-established, successful partnership between two market leaders and will allow InfoSnap and PowerSchool to grow more rapidly as a combined organization.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">PowerSchool is the #1 leading provider of K-12 Student Information Systems (SIS), supporting 40 million users and over 15 million students in more than 70 countries. This acquisition adds more than three million students currently on InfoSnap products to the PowerSchool community and enables PowerSchool to address market demand for integrated registration and school choice solutions for schools, administrators, and families.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Founded in 2000, InfoSnap has developed intuitive, flexible technologies that allow schools to move traditionally paper-based, labor-intensive processes including student registration and school choice/lottery online; improving data quality, enforcing compliance and reducing costs and burdens on school administrators and parents. Acquiring InfoSnap enables PowerSchool to expand its core SIS platform to address the growing market demand for full featured, integrated registration and school choice solutions. In addition, customers of both organizations will see higher levels of innovation, support and services with expanded customer service, support and development teams.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We increasingly hear from school customers and parents that they need help with manual, sometimes frustrating processes of school enrollment / registration and that they must be more transparent in offering school choice and conducting lottery processes. InfoSnap has proven success delivering solutions in these areas, providing significant cost savings, efficiency and improved compliance to schools and enabling better experiences for parents and school administrators.&rdquo; said Hardeep Gulati, CEO of PowerSchool. &ldquo;This acquisition enhances our ability to be an even more valued partner to our school districts by providing best-in-class registration management and school choice solutions that are completely integrated with the SIS."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">PowerSchool has a comprehensive ISV partner program with 150+ partners, delivering integrated solutions that improve the K-12 education experience. PowerSchool and InfoSnap have partnered over the past five years to deliver SIS and Registration solutions to more than two million PowerSchool customers, including PowerSchool&rsquo;s Registration module, powered by InfoSnap technology. InfoSnap also has many customers using other SIS solutions and InfoSnap supports robust integration to most of the SIS providers. With this acquisition, PowerSchool will expand its partner ecosystem, opening integrations between the InfoSnap product line and more K-12 SIS and technology providers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The InfoSnap team is very excited to become part of the PowerSchool team.&rdquo; said Lou Trotter, CEO of InfoSnap. &ldquo;This deal is the culmination of a long, successful partnership and it enables PowerSchool to help thousands of schools streamline administrative processes and better connect administrators, teachers, parents and students by delivering technology that simplifies school registration and school choice."</p>
