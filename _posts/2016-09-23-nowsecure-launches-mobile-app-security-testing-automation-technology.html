<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/news/gi_62852_lab_automated_dashboard.png" width="40%" align="right" style="padding: 15px;" /><p><a href="https://www.nowsecure.com">NowSecure</a> today announced the availability of a first-of-its-kind automated mobile app security testing solution, Lab Automated, that helps enterprises reduce risk resulting from insecure apps by identifying and fixing security flaws prior to release and faster than ever before possible. Security teams, quality assurance groups, and development organizations can request a live Lab Automated demonstration or trial at the NowSecure website, http://www.nowsecure.com.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Enterprises are adopting and developing mobile apps at breakneck speeds. Market intelligence firm IDC forecasts a fourfold increase in the number of mobile apps developed by enterprises by 2018. Security teams struggle to build mobile app security testing processes that keep pace with and fit into modern agile development practices. Gartner Inc. advises enterprises to assume that testing will reveal exploitable security vulnerabilities in 50 percent of apps and predicts that 75 percent of mobile security breaches will result from insecure mobile apps by 2017.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"Automated security testing is the future for mobile security," said Justin Somaini, Chief Security Officer at SAP. "Integrating automated security testing technology with the build-and-deploy cycle pushes security testing for mobile apps out to the development teams, which results in more secure apps while allowing the security teams to focus on complex penetration testing."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Unlike current alternatives, Lab Automated automates static and dynamic app security testing (SAST and DAST) on demand by installing and running apps on physical Android and iOS devices in the cloud. Performing static and dynamic analysis on actual devices, as opposed to emulators, creates a realistic testing environment leading to more accurate results and fewer false positives.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">âAutomating mobile app security assessments is an essential part of an enterprise mobile app security program,â said NowSecure CEO Andrew Hoog. âLab Automated automatically identifies security flaws during the app build-and-test cycles, and does in minutes what previously took days and weeks. Now for the first time an automated security testing tool that runs on actual devices integrates with a DevOps build-and-deploy cycle.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Many enterprise mobile app security programs consist of time-intensive manual testing performed by distributed teams using unstable, unsupported open-source or incomplete commercial technologies. Setting-up, maintaining and cobbling together reports from these tools exhausts security practitionersâ already limited, not to mention expensive, time.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">To free security teams up for more in-depth app analysis, an API integrates Lab Automated directly into the development technology stack so that every time a developer submits an app build, they receive immediate, detailed feedback about vulnerabilities in the app along with clear instructions about how to fix them.</p>
