<p><a href="http://www.internetvideoarchive.com/">Internet Video Archive (IVA)</a>, the world&rsquo;s largest online distributor of movie, TV, and game trailers, announces the debut of AdQ, a free real time video ad optimization tool that restores the balance of power in the digital media landscape between publishers and advertisers by letting publishers gain control of their video ads.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Video publishers find themselves at the mercy of their ads sources. Video ads notoriously provide a poor user experience. Ad management platforms don&rsquo;t focus on missed opportunities to generate revenue for publishers. Publishers are unable to address these issues because the reports they get from advertiser-centric ad management platforms arrive too late for action, and the interfaces do not provide the data needed or recommend any adjustments.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AdQ&rsquo;s patent-pending technology logs player events and measures the performance of each ad in real time. It then automatically requests the ad that is best for both user experience and publisher revenue. Further, AdQ scales to fit any publisher&rsquo;s needs, from 10,000 to 10 billion requests per day. This allows AdQ publishers to level the playing field in their interactions with advertisers.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;AdQ is built upon the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, including Microsoft Azure Cloud Services for all of its web roles and worker roles, including the AdQ dashboard, ad serving, analytics and performance analysis,&rdquo; says Bob Kolo, IVA&rsquo;s VP of Technology. &ldquo;AdQ uses Azure Redis Cache clusters for caching which helps it scale to support tens of thousands of requests per second. AdQ&rsquo;s reports and reporting APIs utilize SQL database to seamlessly scale to meet demand. AdQ also takes advantage of Azure Storage to manage and scale workflows.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">John Deutscher, Principal Program Manager, Azure Media Services, said &ldquo;AdQ is a great example of cloud-based ad management. It utilizes Microsoft Azure at scale to perform advertisement optimizations in real-time, using data analysis built on top of several Microsoft Azure services.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AdQ is free&mdash;no trial periods, no limited time offers. Affordable upgrade packages for even more powerful versions of AdQ are available.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Video publishers have been asking for a solution to the problem of underperforming video ads. AdQ is that solution.</p>
