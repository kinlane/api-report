<p><a href="http://www.maritzmotivation.com/">Maritz Motivation Solutions</a>, a leader in providing consumer loyalty programs to US and global companies, announced that it has partnered with Gigya, provider of a leading customer management platform, to bring social connections to the forefront of Maritz customer loyalty programs.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">By integrating Gigya with the Maritz LoyaltyNext&reg; platform, loyalty members can sign into rewards programs and engage with other members via their social media accounts. With the platform, marketers don&rsquo;t have to create separate sites or custom applications. It also gives brands the ability to harness rich social data in a secure and privacy compliant way as part of their program analytics.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">According to Maritz, the most loyal consumers are those who exhibit &ldquo;cult loyalty,&rdquo; personally identifying with the values of the brand and actively seeking to connect socially with fellow brand loyalists. &ldquo;It shifts the program from being a solitary experience about you and your rewards and earnings, to one that now can be about you and your friends and the brands you love together,&rdquo; said Barry Kirk, VP Customer Loyalty Strategy for Maritz Motivation Solutions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The Maritz LoyaltyNext&reg; Customer Study, which surveyed 2,000 US consumers, shows that loyalty members want more social experiences. According to the data:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>1 in 5 customers wish they could interact or compete with friends or family within loyalty programs.</li>
<li>37% wish they could share or combine points or other earnings toward rewards with friends/family who are also enrolled in the program.</li>
<li>32% wish they could team up with family and friends toward reaching common goals.</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Customers are looking for unique and engaging experiences, particularly Gen X and millennial consumers,&rdquo; added Kirk. &ldquo;By creating social experiences and emotional connections, you can forge deeper relationships with your customers. The partnership with Gigya allows us to make the loyalty program social experience easier and more convenient for marketers and brands.&rdquo;</p>
