<p><a href="http://www.italentcorp.com">iTalent Corporation</a>, a global digital transformation services and cloud integration company and Lithium Partner, and&nbsp;Lingotek, a leader in cloud-based translation solutions, are announcing the official launch of a solution to break down the language barrier for Lithium customers. Lithium, which sees more than 100 million people on its Community platform monthly, adds a new level to its service with the Lithium - Translation Connector, further helping its customers to connect, engage, and understand its clientele.</p>
<p>Combining iTalent&rsquo;s expertise in digital transformation with Lingotek&rsquo;s translation capabilities, the team was able to create a unique platform integration for Lithium&rsquo;s client base to improve the overall execution of their business in global markets. Built on Lingotek&rsquo;s open Multilingual API, the Lithium - Translation Connector integrates various features to improve localization of content and language consistency, ultimately resulting in cost savings and a faster time to market.</p>
<p>The Lithium - Translation Connector provides a user friendly and cost effective solution to multilingual business partners and consumers on an international level. Keeping in mind that the economy is ever shifting to be more digital in nature, iTalent and Lingotek collaborated to ensure that their customers have the necessary tools to be able to adjust with the change and keep up with the pace of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lithium - Translation Connector is an essential tool to aid and support the global business economy,&rdquo; says iTalent CEO, Renee La Londe. &ldquo;We are excited to use our collaborative skills and talents to address this immediate challenge and enhance the digital transformation of businesses everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At their core, Lithium Communities are about connecting people to each other, and to the brands they love,&rdquo; said Sunil Rajasekar, Chief Technology Officer, Lithium Technologies. &ldquo;These new translation capabilities allow consumers to share their experiences more broadly, regardless of language barrier or geography, and remove what has been a persistent obstacle in business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve enjoyed collaborating with iTalent to provide this solution for Lithium&rsquo;s clientele,&rdquo; adds Lingotek President and CEO, Robert Vandenberg. &ldquo;We look forward to continuing our work together to further develop this technology and further navigate around obstacles to improve efficiency and encourage consumer engagement.&rdquo;</p>
