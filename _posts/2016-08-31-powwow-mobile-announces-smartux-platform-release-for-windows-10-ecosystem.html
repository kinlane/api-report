<p><a href="http://www.powwowmobile.com">PowWow Mobile</a>, the leading enterprise mobility platform that allows companies to deliver powerful, modern native mobile apps quickly, simply and economically, today announced its SmartUX Platform release for the Windows 10 ecosystem at VMworld US 2016. In doing so, PowWow Mobile is now the only enterprise mobility platform that can modernize legacy Windows and web applications by delivering native apps purpose built for Microsoft&rsquo;s Universal Windows Platform (UWP).</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Currently, Windows 10 runs on more than 350 million devices in 192 countries around the world and Microsoft is targeting deployment on one billion Windows 10 devices by 2018. To support Microsoft apps across numerous devices, Microsoft introduced UWP, platform homogeneous application architecture, in Windows 10. The architecture helps developers create universal apps that run on any Windows 10 device family, including personal computers (PCs), tablets, smartphones, ruggedized devices, Microsoft Hololens and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Over 96 percent of Microsoft&rsquo;s Windows enterprise customers are already testing Windows 10, yet nearly 72 percent of enterprises are still running applications built using legacy versions of Windows,&rdquo; said PowWow Mobile CEO Kia Behnia. &ldquo;Until now, the only option companies had for extending these legacy applications to mobile users was through application virtualization. PowWow Mobile&rsquo;s SmartUX Platform solves this problem with the addition of native UWP support for Windows 10.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">PowWow Mobile&rsquo;s SmartUX Platform is an end-to-end solution, designed to extend any Windows or Web application, data source or workflow out to any endpoint, whether that is Windows 10, iOS, Android or HTML5. The platform&rsquo;s inherent power negates complexities that are commonly associated with legacy applications, which are unable to leverage the powerful features of Windows 10. As a result, the SmartUX Platform is the only solution to that can transform any application into modern, intuitive native mobile apps.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The PowWow SmartUX Platform allows the enterprise to:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li>Rapidly transform any legacy Windows and web application or workflow into a native mobile app in days.</li>
<li>Connect to any third-party data source, API or SQL to build new mobile-first apps.</li>
<li>Create Smart Apps that bring together multiple systems, data and logic into one simple mobile workflow.</li>
<li>Design modern mobile experiences seamlessly with PowWow Studio, a powerful visual editor.</li>
<li>Run anywhere (public, private or hybrid cloud, or on-premises), on any device (PC, laptop, tablet, phone, or watch) and any OS (Windows 10, iOS, Android, HTML5).</li>
<li>Deliver secure apps through integration with leading Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) platforms, such as AirWatch by VMware.</li>
</ul>
