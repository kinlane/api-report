<p class="responsiveNews"><a href="http://www.nuxeo.com">Nuxeo</a>, provider of the Nuxeo Platform, a highly customizable and extensible content management platform for building business applications, announced the availability of Nuxeo University. Now Nuxeo Platform developers and users have access to on-demand courses to increase their proficiency and accelerate learning. These educational courses are available to accompany Nuxeo's free documentation resources. A full course catalog is available at <a onclick="linkClick(this.href)" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cHM6Ly91bml2ZXJzaXR5Lm51eGVvLmlvLw==">https://university.nuxeo.io/</a></p>
<p class="responsiveNews">"We believe that anyone working on or with the Nuxeo Platform can benefit from these online training videos," said Alain Escaffre, Director of Product Management at Nuxeo. "Our on-demand training classes were created to enable any Nuxeo user to quickly become familiar with the software for improved efficiency and faster decision-making."</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The on-demand courses allow the viewer to watch any or all of the videos at their own pace. Built around thematic courses for all levels, each one will take the viewer through a specific aspect of the platform. As of today, Nuxeo University is offering one course to get you started with Nuxeo Studio. This first course covers different topics of Nuxeo Studio such as:</p>
<ul class="releaseul">
<li> Customize the look and feel of your application</li>
<li> Design your own content model</li>
<li> Create your own business logic</li>
</ul>
<p class="responsiveNews">In the near future, Nuxeo will release a course on the Nuxeo Platform's core, out-of-the-box, features, and a more advanced course around REST API usage.</p>
