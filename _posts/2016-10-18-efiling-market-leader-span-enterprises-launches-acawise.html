ACAwise, SPANâs newest cloud-based program, aims to be that solution for the Affordable Care Act compliance management and e-filing requirements for applicable large employers, insurance providers, and tax professionals.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With its passing, the Affordable Care Act enacted new IRS Internal Revenue Code Sections 6055 and 6056, which require Applicable Large Employers (ALEs) and other providers of health insurance to meet certain coverage conditions and report them to the IRS each year. In order to successfully comply with these new requirements, employers and insurance providers will need to track information of coverage offered throughout the year and submit their results on Forms 1094 and 1095.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ACAwise is the first IRS-authorized e-filing software to also offer in-depth compliance tracking for users throughout the year; it really is a one-stop-shop for ACA compliance.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Created specifically for high-volume filers, ACAwise is a customizable software designed to be personalized for each account holder and even offers API Integration. ALEs and other business owners can use ACAwise to track and manage coverage offered to employees. With the real-time dashboard, users can enter employee and coverage data throughout the year. At the beginning of each filing season, ACAwise will create reporting Forms 1094 and 1095 based on the information the user provided. Upon approval, these forms are securely e-filed directly with the IRS and recipient copies are mailed from ACAwiseâs headquarters in South Carolina.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Employers arenât the only ones who stand to benefit from ACAwise. Accountants, insurance providers, and other compliance and consulting companies, known as third-party administrators, can create an account with ACAwise to manage their clientsâ ACA reporting needs. They also have the option to sign up for a White Label account which, in addition to the real-time compliance tracking and e-filing offer with each account, includes a custom portal site with a personalized URL, branding, and color scheme. Through this portal site, accounting and compliance firms can provide information about the services they offer, promote their own company as the ACA provider, and answer any questions for their clients.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">At the heart of every SPAN product, including ACAwise, is the support team of e-filing experts trained to provide world-class customer support. ACAwise will offer 24/7 US-based support in English and Spanish from the companyâs headquarters in Rock Hill, South Carolina.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Joining the established ExpressTaxZone, which includes products like ExpressTruckTax and ExpressIRSForms, ACAwise is sure to make a place for itself within SPANâs growing line of e-filing products while standing out among competing ACA e-filing services.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">SPAN Enterprises launched ACAwise this week and will offer free e-filing for ALEs based in York County, South Carolina for the 2016 tax year. SPANâs vision is to help other businesses succeed and the decision to offer free ACA compliance and e-filing to ALEâs in their community reflects that vision.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">For other interested businesses, a monthly subscription charge for ACAwise is still being determined, but potential users can call ACAwise account managers for a quote based on their filing size.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">ACAwise is on the forefront of the ACA compliance and filing industry. SPAN Enterprises anticipates a lucrative launch and subsequent success for ACAwise as the need for simple and reliable ACA compliance retention and management continues to rise.</p>
