<p><a href="https://www.eagleeyenetworks.com">Eagle Eye Networks</a> today announced that it has awarded $1.25 Million in Drako Cloud Security Grants to schools throughout the United States. A broad range of public and private schools were awarded the Drako Grant for a fully functional security camera system &mdash; including cloud management and recording, mobile phone remote access applications, cameras, networking equipment to connect IP cameras, and secure gateways to the cloud &mdash; at no cost for one year.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The initial Drako Grant total amount was set at $1 Million when it was announced in March 2016. Grants over the initial committed amount have been made since so many applications with such strong need continue to be received. Since the need is so high, the original July 1, 2016 application deadline has also been extended to December 1, 2016.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We are enthusiastic about helping schools create a safer place for the children,&rdquo; said Dean Drako, President and CEO of Eagle Eye Networks. &ldquo;The variety of the schools that have applied demonstrates that school security is a universal objective regardless of the location and environment.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">Vine School: Private school for children with Autism Spectrum Disorders - Victoria, Texas</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Erin Hatley, Executive Director of the Vine School, commented:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The Vine School is a private school for children ages two through eighteen diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders. As our program grows and the needs of our students and staff evolve, we find it very important to have policies and procedures in place to keep everyone at The Vine School safe and secure.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;We find it extremely important to provide our parents and staff the peace of mind knowing that each of our students is treated with dignity, respect and in accordance with best practices. Unfortunately, costs associated with purchasing, installing, maintaining and archiving an efficient surveillance system are not a small expense and could be detrimental to our budget.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Receiving the Drako Cloud Security Grant from Eagle Eye Networks is a wonderful opportunity for The Vine School. It allows us to continue to provide the caliber of education our parents and community expect and that our students deserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="responsiveNews">Michelle Kimbro, Curriculum Coordinator of Oakwood High School, stated:</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Oakwood High School has almost 300 students. During the last school year we had two break-ins at the high school and damage was done to the building. Our school budgets are tight, and there was no money left for security at either of the two remaining buildings.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;Our school building sits outside of town and is hard to watch over. Our high school principal came across the Drako Cloud Security Grant, and after further investigation, we recognized the Grant Award for the Eagle Eye Networks VMS cloud recording and 16 video cameras would be perfect for our high school.&rdquo;</p>
