<p>The Staples Easy System brings the âon-demandâ world to businesses, allowing customers to order anytime, anywhere, from any device they prefer. By tapping into IBMâs Watson Conversation service, Staples now offers a seamless ordering interface for customers across the Staples Easy System ecosystem â whether itâs via Staplesâ proprietary next-generation Easy Button, through the app, text, email, over Facebook Messenger or with a Slackbot. The Watson-enabled interface simplifies the customersâ shopping experience, allowing them to quickly reorder supplies, track shipments or chat about customer service needs.</p>
<p>In addition to facilitating simpler interactions with customers, cognitive capabilities built into the system and powered by a combination of Watson Knowledge Studio and Staplesâ own internal personalization APIs will help the Staples Easy System learn more about each businessesâ preferences over time, including their preferred products and quantities. Eventually, the system will even be able to make product and services recommendations based on the customerâs current needs.</p>
<p>âStaples and IBM have combined the power of Watson technology with Staplesâ expertise in helping small and medium businesses to transform how companies shop for everything they need for their office,â said Faisal Masud, executive vice president, eCommerce and customer experience, Staples. âWith the Easy System, administrators will have greater overall management of their organizationsâ procurement processes, ultimately saving them time they can instead spend on running their office. Itâs the assistantâs assistant.â</p>
<p>Since announcing the Staples Easy System solution earlier this year, Staplesâ Applied Innovation, e-Commerce and IT teams have been working on adding features and services to benefit business customers, including:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Speech-to-text capability, translating the inbound audio stream from the customer to Staples, which then allows for recognition of what they want to order or ask the Easy System.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">The ability to view and playback all requests received from the customerâs Easy Button, allowing both the customer and Staples to listen to captured audio, review submissions from any of their devices and verify the requested items.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Strengthening the customer service chat feature with IBMâs Watson Conversation service, allowing the system to quickly respond to common requests, like checking on product availability.</li>
<li class="bwlistitemmargb">Self-monitoring status updates through an API that sends a request to the Easy System from the Easy Button to check if button is online or not. If the Easy System detects that button is not online then it will send an email to the customer to alert them before the next time they try and make an order.</li>
</ul>
<p>âA critical component of Watsonâs technology is engagement, facilitating better interactions between brands and consumers, deepening connections and enhancing how people engage,â said Steve Abrams, distinguished engineer and vice president of developer advocacy, IBM Watson. âOur collaboration with Staples puts cognitive in the palm of the consumerâs hand, streamlining business operations and creating a frictionless customer experience.â</p>
<p>The Easy Button is being rolled out via Alpha Test to a small subset of Staples Business Advantage customers in the Austin, TX market. This will be followed by a broader Beta Test rollout to over 100 additional customers in Austin and New York before the year-end.</p>
<p>Staples is continuing to investigate other applications for the Easy System technology, including integrating additional Watson-related APIs in the future that could help with other tasks like booking a flight, ordering flowers or even making dinner reservations. Other future applications could come from the Easy Buttonâs âInternet of Thingsâ capabilities, allowing it to connect to, and communicate with, other smart devices, like a printer that tells the button when itâs low on toner.</p>

<p>The Alpha and Beta tests of the Easy Button are part of a larger initiative from Staples to make easier shopping happen, which also includes the recently announced âScan My Listâ functionality for Staplesâ iOS mobile app, which lets a customer scan their shopping list or even take a picture of their breakroom to generate a Staples.com order.</p>
