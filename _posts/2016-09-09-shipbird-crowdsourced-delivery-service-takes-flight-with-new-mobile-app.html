<p>Earlier this month, Marc Diamond, founder of the innovative crowdsourced delivery platform, <a href="http://www.shipbird.com/">Shipbird</a>, with CTO Kris Subramanian, launched their very own mobile app for its users. Shipbird was created in August of 2013 after brainstorming a more efficient way to deliver goods with the help of everyday commuters and willingness of businesses to drop traditional shipment methods. Since then, the service has delivered thousands of packages in the San Francisco Bay Area Region of Northern California and beyond. With their recently announced mobile app now in effect, the company is excited to simplify the delivery process by connecting their network of drivers with just the tap of a touchscreen. Marc was equally ecstatic claiming that, &ldquo;the Shipbird App, while sophisticated, offers our birds a simple, intuitive, delivery app that provides them industry-leading income for completing local deliveries. They can start their own delivery business using their vehicle of choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The exclusive app currently only available for iOS consists of a popular tech stack similar to a MEAN stack (MySql, Express, Angular JS, Node JS). MEAN is an effective system because it offers users with everything they need to manage their tasks, store records and monitor activity. After adjusting the order APIs and basic authenticated logins, Shipbird has developed a nearly seamless way for members to sign in using their Shipbird User ID and Paypal User ID; both needed for receiving delivery requests and payments. The app was written with Swift and integrates Google Maps to show the digital landscape of their service region. In addition, the map's display has an address bar and custom static pin that users can drag freely until reaching a preferred point to view their current location and target destination. The sender and recipient info along with the date and ETA are visible at the top of UIVview (Upfront Income Verification). Developers were able to customize its details allowing them to optimize the appearance and tone of every view for smooth and coherent transitions.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews"><strong>Background</strong><br />Over the last decade, logistics expert Marc Diamond has founded over 6 businesses in 3 verticals. Hailing out of the University of Texas at Austin in the class of 2001, Marc distributed steel at his family-owned Metal Supplies Company. He helped grow the business from 15 employees to over 100 nearly reaching $200 million in revenue over the course of 13 years. Shortly after being acquired from a private equity firm in 2006, Marc relocated to an investment property in Sonoma County in 2010. Attracted to the innovative environment of the digital field, Marc contributed his own idea to the tech-bubble launching Shipbird in 2013. Thanks to the help of developer and full stack engineer, Kris Subramanian, Marc was able to extend his vision into everyday life. Kris has an expansive background in the electronic and computer science fields with 3 separate degrees; most recently from the University of Florida in 2006. He has founded/co-founded 3 startups specializing in messaging and social space. He is currently the leading architect and developer of the Shipbird REST APIs and critiqued its function for optimal performance.</p>
