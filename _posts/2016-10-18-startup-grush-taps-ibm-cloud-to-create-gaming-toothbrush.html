Grush turns brushing into a real-time interactive app on mobile devices through Bluemix and the Watson Analytics API.</p>

<p>Using advanced motion-sensing technology, Grush captures thousands of data points while a child is brushing and sends them via Bluetooth to the IBM Cloud, where they are analyzed and turned into fun mobile brushing games. For example, the "Toothy Castles" game allows children to wipe away monsters in the areas of the mouth that have not been brushed.</p>
<p>The data is also made available to the Watson Analytics API, which provides predictive analytics and data visualization through a mobile dashboard app that allows children's parents and dentists to track their brushing.</p>
<p>Grush was able to easily connect the mobile and analytics pieces of its solution thanks to the newly launched IBM Cloud Architecture Center, a library of cloud architectures and sample code to help developers speed development cycles and connect all their services on Bluemix, IBM's cloud platform. There, Grush leveraged an IoT architecture and quickly extended it to include mobile and analytics, saving considerable development time and hassle.</p>
<p>Grush also turned to IBM for its Global Entrepreneur program, which provides startups with access to resources like IBM Cloud credits, tech support and business mentorship. IBM supports Grush by helping the startup refine its pitches, tweak its business model and perfect the backbone of&nbsp;its&nbsp;solution&mdash;its IBM Cloud Bluemix environment.</p>
<p>"We see ourselves as a true technology and go-to-market partner for our developers and startups," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Sandy Carter</span>, IBM's General Manager, Developer Ecosystem and Startups. "Their success is our success."</p>
<p>"The personalized,&nbsp;first hand&nbsp;support from the IBM Global Entrepreneur program is unparalleled," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Ethan Schur</span>,&nbsp;cofounder&nbsp;and COO of Grush. "IBM will talk with you in depth to understand your goals and needs and work with you on a plan of action. For us, this has been critical."</p>
