<p class="responsiveNews">âGlooko will be joining AMC Healthâs extensive ecosystem of healthcare technology partners that have chosen to integrate into AMC Healthâs CareConsoleÂ® virtual care platform. This partnership with Glooko will give patients the flexibility of using their existing glucometers and support stronger connections with their clinical teams on a real-time basis, while also expanding care beyond the walls of hospitals, doctorsâ offices and outpatient settings,â said Nesim Bildirici, founder and CEO of AMC Health. âOur clinically proven solutions, and clinical, technology and analytics expertise, gained over millions of patient days, ensure that our solutions promote patient engagement, improve patient outcomes, and prevent costly acute episodes.â</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">AMC Health has been performing groundbreaking work in remote patient monitoring and engagement since its founding in 2002, and has consistently partnered with organizations to assist with the identification of patients with the highest risks, likelihood of hospitalizations, and utilization of services. AMC Health has demonstrated, in peer-reviewed clinical studies, that its remote patient monitoring and engagement solutions have reduced hospital readmissions for patients with heart failure and reduced their cost of care. AMC Health solutions have also helped patients with diabetes significantly reduce their HbA1c levels and patients with hypertension substantially reduce and control their blood pressure. These results have been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), Journal of Managed Care Medicine, Medical Care and Population Health Management.</p>
