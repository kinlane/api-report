With this powerful solution, administrators can seamlessly and securely control cloud-based, hybrid, or on-premises email and file-sharing.</p>
<p>Enterprises are increasingly adopting cloud strategies to collaborate across departments and geographies. However, without robust encryption, policy enforcement and centralized management, organizations can run the risk of virus exposure, governance and compliance failures, or even loss of valuable data.</p>
<p>The content management capability of Axway MailGate SC allows high-security access to critical data via different devices, including mobile. Organizations can utilize either a full-cloud or hybrid architecture by implementing the same security policy and efficiency throughout the entire enterprise. In addition to its availability on Microsoft Azure, Axway MailGate SC can now integrate with Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Exchange to create a comprehensive, enterprise-grade solution for collaboration.</p>
<p>âAs cloud and hybrid environments and work styles continue to evolve, particularly with collaboration across mobile environments, the need for security is vital,â said Jeanine Banks, executive vice president, global products and solutions, Axway. âWith the combination of Axway MailGate SC on Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Office 365 or SharePoint or Exchange, customers can benefit from a strong suite of productivity tools, to safely foster collaboration in our growing world of connected, digital business. This availability of MailGate on Microsoft Azure is a strengthening our relationship with Microsoft.â</p>
