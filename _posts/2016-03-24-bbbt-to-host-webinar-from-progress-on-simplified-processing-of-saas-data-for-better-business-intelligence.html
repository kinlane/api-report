<p>On Friday, March 25, 2016, <a href="http://www.bbbt.us/">BBBT members</a> will be briefed by <a href="http://www.progress.com">Progress</a> general manager, Dion Picco, and chief data evangelist, Sumit Sarkar, who will provide an update on the explosion of SaaS (Software as a Service) data.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">The average company has over 20 SaaS applications deployed, and as lines-of-business take control over technology selection, that number is going to skyrocket.  Doing BI against the myriad of proprietary APIs these applications expose is time consuming, error prone, and a drain on IT resources.  Progress gives its customers the competitive edge they need to thrive.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;The allure of cloud-based software applications has grown tremendously in recent years. It is remarkably simple to get started. However, with that simplicity comes the massive complexity of attempting to analyze the data locked in these disparate apps,&rdquo; said BBBT Founder Claudia Imhoff. &ldquo;I look forward to hearing a solution to this problem from Progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very exciting to get the collective experience of the BBBT to better serve our customers and partners,&rdquo; said Mr. Picco. &ldquo;We are in a unique position such that many of the BBBT presenters to date are OEM partners distributing our BI connectivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">A podcast summarizing the presentation will be available at the BBBT podcasts page, and a video and trailer of the presentation will be available at the BBBT videos page.</p>
