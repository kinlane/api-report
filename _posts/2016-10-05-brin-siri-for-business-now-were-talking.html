Beaumont is the founder of BRiN, a free smartphone app that has become the worldâs first business advisor in your pocket.</p>
<p>Voice-powered assistants are already telling us what to wear, how to navigate traffic, and the outcome of the latest game of our favorite sports team. Now BRiNâs team of software programmers says itâs possible for digital assistants to tell us how to run a business.</p>
<p>âWe discovered that only 1% of the 500 million business owners on the planet have access to a business advisor,â Beaumont explains. The goal, therefore, is to create the worldâs first artificially intelligent business advisor. âThink Siri for business and youâre just about there,â Beaumont says.</p>
<p>The first phase of the BRiN app â a prototype business advisor and large library of training videos â has just been released and is available globally. Early results have been impressive with over 10,000 business owners signing up for the free service within the first three months.</p>
<p>The teamâs focus is now on software and the second phase of BRiN, the AI powered business advisor, which will launch in early 2017.</p>
<p>In the future, BRiN will also connect through API to other business applications such as Salesforce, MailChimp, QuickBooks and Google Analytics.Â âYouâll be able to verbally ask BRiN about your numbers: how many leads in your pipeline; the conversion rate of your website; and even how much you spent on electricity in the month of July,â explains Beaumont.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning for BRiN. âOne day BRiN will even help you book flights, disperse payroll, and order stationary. And it can all be done hands-free, while driving to the office.â</p>
<p>Beaumont reveals their goal is to get 100,000 business owners using BRiN within the next year. From there, theyâll begin introducing paid subscription plans.</p>
