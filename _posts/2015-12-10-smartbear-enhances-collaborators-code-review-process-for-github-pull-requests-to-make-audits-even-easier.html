<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="http://smartbear.com">SmartBear Software</a>, the leader in software quality tools for the connected world, has released Collaborator 9.4, continuing its investment in GitHub integration and Collaborator&rsquo;s archiving feature. SmartBear&rsquo;s peer code review tool, Collaborator, enhances the code review process for GitHub pull requests to make audits even easier. Collaborator 9.4 also adds new security features. Collaborator is the only tool available that allows teams to peer review code, user stories and test plans in a transparent, collaborative framework &ndash; instantly keeping the entire team up to speed on changes made to the code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span class="s1">&ldquo;SmartBear continues to invest in Collaborator features that enable large enterprises to utilize one tool for peer review as well as integrations with third party tools such as IDE's,&rdquo; said Justin Collier, Product Owner, Collaborator at SmartBear. &ldquo;As well, Collaborator 9.4 ensures that teams can use repository management tools on a large scale, while also guaranteeing that peer reviews are happening in a scalable and auditable environment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">With the continued improvements to Collaborator&rsquo;s GitHub integration and the &ldquo;Archive to Zip&rdquo; feature added in October, the burden of providing auditors with the information needed from peer reviews is easier than ever. Development, testing and management teams can save code review contents in a zip file for long term data retention.</span></p>
