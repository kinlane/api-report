<p>The Toll-Free industry has not changed significantly since the break-up of AT&amp;T in 1984. However, the volume of Toll-Free calling as a percentage of business voice traffic has been steadily increasing. The industry is in need of change, and thinQ TFLCR heralds this change.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">There more than 40 million Toll-Free numbers in use today, managed by one of more than 400 Responsible Organizations (RespOrg&rsquo;s). Now, for the first time, call centers, enterprise clients and carriers may access an easy-to-use disaster recovery solution in the event of a Toll-Free carrier outage. Traditional methods for Toll-Free don&rsquo;t provide disaster recovery or load balancing when tied to a single provider. thinQ&rsquo;s new TFLCR provides best cost pricing across multiple providers with easy-to-use disaster recovery options.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">With thinQ&rsquo;s TFLCR platform, customers can select multiple carriers for Toll-Free calls based on calling area, call quality, etc. and always receive the best pricing. Using thinQ&rsquo;s intuitive portal, customers can make routing changes to single numbers, or to groups of numbers. thinQ clients will be able to set up routing profiles that optimize costs based on their traffic patterns. The portal dashboard will enable clients to see their average costs per call and allow access to call data. The thinQ analytics engine continuously analyzes the traffic for possible pattern changes for better cost optimization. The Toll-Free analytics engine analyzes traffic patterns and applies those patterns thereby optimizing traffic for maximum client savings on a call-by-call basis.</p>
<p class="responsiveNews">Whether you are a carrier or a large call center, thinQ TFLCR clients can expect better call completion, increased operational control, and cost savings.
