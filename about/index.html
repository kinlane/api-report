title: About The API Report
---

<p>API.Report is where I publish the API related press releases that I process each day as part of my monitoring of the API space. Currently I pull releases from PR Newswire, but I will be opening that up to other services in the near future. Press releases are a great way to tell which companies, institutions, organizations, and government agencies are doing APIs.</p>
<p>Press releases are not in chronological release order, as they are all entered into a database, and processed as I have time. The date for each post is the date / time in which I published to API.Report. The site is meant to reflect which API related news releases I'm tuned into for the week.</p>
<p>After each press release is published, using the Github repository that drives the web site, I pull any company names, and URLs referenced in each release. Once a company is added to my API monitoring system I also pull a logo, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Github accounts, as well as any RSS, Atom, XML, or JSON feeds that I discover.</p>
<p>You can find my analysis of the API space on <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, and find the regular stream of companies who are doing APIs, and talking about it here on API.Report. If you have a story you would like to submit, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-report">submit a pull request on the sites Github repository</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/kinlane/api-report/issues">submit as an issue</a>--either way I'll get around to publishing it as part of my regular work in this area.</p>
