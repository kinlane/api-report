<h1>Curated API News</h1>
<p>Each week I curate news from across the space for inclusion in my storytelling, and research--this is a list of each week that I have published a roundup of all the links I included.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="august-22nd-2016/">August 22nd, 2016</a></li>
  <li><a href="august-15th-2016/">August 15th, 2016</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have been doing this since 2013, but it will take some time to get all the weeks published in this new format that drives this page.</p>
