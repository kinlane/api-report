<p class="mytitle">Editorial Policy</p>	
<p>The editorial policy right now is pretty basic. Keep all stories simple, non-spammy, news stories about anything related to APIs. Stories should be no more than 500 words, provide an informative summary of the API happening.</p>
<p>Don't post anything that isn't meant for a wide audience, including teenagers. We aren't looking to be a link-bait site, just an informative location where you can find the latest APIs news.</p>
<p>As issues arise, I will update this editorial policy to be more inclusive, for right now just make sure things are kept simple, clean, and bringing value to the API community.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to email info@apievangelist.com or tweet at @apireport.</p>
